Your training as an engineer and domain knowledge is certainly useful is DS/Analytics field and will come in handy. Dont be ready to settle for an entry level position after you switch to a DS role, ask for a senior or lead role. Engineers, including myself, have a tendency to undervalue our non-DS knowledge. I can tell you that your engineering background is a huge asset and definitely not a liability in a DS role. Also, make sure you get paid more, not less, than what you currently make. Traditional non-SW engineering doesnt pay much hence you may be surprised at what you can get in a DS role. Finally, get little creative and describe your work experience in your resume that looks like you blended DS with engineering. If you cant think of anything, start exploring opportunities where you start bringing in elements of DS/ML in your regular job in your current workplace. In other words, start preparing to pitch yourself as someone who has been working at the intersection of DS and engineering for the last X years and finally decided to get a masters in the field to get more in-depth knowledge.

You should take a look at the TensorFlow Profiler, it will help you diagnose what is causing it. There are so many different things that can lead to this it's very hard to diagnose without looking at your code. The profiler can help narrow it down so you see where it happens.

Look at when the memory leak occurs using htop or a similar program that shows RAM usage by process. Is it during validation? Is it after the 1st epoch? Sometimes variables are not released from memory after each epoch so memory just continues to be filled until the limit is hit.

You can also use the nvidia-smi command in the terminal to show you memory usage on the GPU side. 

Once, I had a memory leak like this that ended up having to do with an incorrect Docker GPU base image. It was literally a small versioning typo. So unfortunately, you will have to dig deeper yourself or at least post more info when you've narrowed it down a bit further.","5"

If memory is exploding that fast and it is the code, you've likely got a loop somewhere that's building a far larger memory buffer than you think, or your executing some operations on a dataset recursively or something.

The real threat to tech jobs right now is a combination of massive over hiring in Covid coupled with companies dumping existing workers to invest in AI, with to be honest just on the off chance that the technology will live up to its hype.

The IT industry is always cyclic, everybody over hires for the latest shiny thing, and every body jumps on that bandwagon. Remember the Y2K boom, then the .com bomb that followed. Did the Internet disappear as a result, nope.

There was a kills shortage for full stack and for data science positions, so every person and there dog trained for that assuming there would be jobs for and for forever. Now with a glut of those skills and companies jumping on the AI bandwagon with the assumption it will replace everything theres a great slump in demand. As companies retool for it - instead of retraining - they just dump people to increase profitability. However, many will find you dont downsize your way to sustained growth even in the medium term.

Same old, same old, technology disturbance handled poorly as tech companies follow each other like sheep, where if our competitors do it we must too to not get left behind. Its a 5 year cycle. The worst attrition is for those industry employees who are not technical per se, product and project managers, middle managers, strategists, consultants, marketing, sales management, HR etc.. It will be grim for them until the next cycle starts booming.","18"

There will likely be a period over a few years where automation is introduced and we all struggle to maintain and adapt. In this period there won't be massive layoffs IMO, but they could come after that. This is where retraining and UBI will be a huge saving grace for the standard American.

Consider voting for leaders who are actively discussing these issues and how greatly they impact everyone who doesn't have a STEM degree. Not every American can code, but its possible that with the significant gains in capital produced by automation, that wealth could be redistributed to create a utopia where Americans working minimum wage roles could be free to produce art or work a passion that previously could not be possible without robotics and the post-scarcity world they create.","21"

But AI will not always grow at an exponential rate, after some time it will plateau and then its limitations will emerge. It's difficult to understand what possible limitations it might have but it will surely emerge in due time.

So, AI will make a lot of jobs go extinct but not all of the jobs and it will create a lot of new jobs also.

I also think that a lot of companies will use AI to expand rather than focus entirely on cost cutting. For example, if the job of 10 people can be done by 2 then companies will give 4 more projects to the remaining 8 and expand their capacity. AI will lead to a more efficient utilisation of resources so the resources will be used to expand capacity, because during industrialisation when a producer realised that he can get the same work done in less time and with less people then he started producing more in same time with maybe a bit less people.","25"

Turns out that's not the case, or at least it's not so obvious. The irony is that all those manual jobs your parents always told you to avoid in favour of college degrees are looking more stable than ever, at least in relative terms. We'll probably have an AI lawyer long before an AI bricklayer.

Let's break down your points and add some additional insights:

1. **AI Tools for Data Scientists**: Absolutely, the primary users of AI tools in data science are data professionals themselves. The emphasis on making these tools work for them rather than replacing them underscores the role of AI as an augmentative technology. It's critical that these tools are designed with the end-user in mind, focusing on usability, integration into existing workflows, and genuinely solving the challenges faced by data scientists. This user-centric approach is essential for widespread adoption.

2. **Productivity Benefits with Human Oversight**: Your point about AI providing productivity benefits while requiring human oversight is spot-on. Tools like GitHub Copilot serve as powerful examples of how AI can boost efficiency and creativity without eliminating the need for human expertise. In data science, AI can automate routine tasks (data cleaning, preliminary analysis, etc.) but the nuanced understanding, decision-making, and strategic thinking that data scientists bring to the table are irreplaceable. This partnership between AI and humans enhances the analytical process rather than detracting from it.

3. **Lowering Barriers to Data Access**: The comparison to the advent of spreadsheets is enlightening. By making data more accessible and the analysis process more efficient, AI tools could indeed democratize data science to an extent, expanding the pool of data professionals and enabling more complex and deeper analyses. This doesn't mean reducing the value of data scientists but rather empowering more individuals to engage in data-driven decision-making and innovation.

4. **Simplifying the Presentation of Insights**: The potential for AI to streamline the conversion of complex analyses into digestible formats is exciting and has significant implications for how insights are communicated across organizations. By reducing the time and effort required to translate findings into actionable business insights, AI can facilitate a more agile, informed decision-making process. This aspect of AI's impact could bridge the gap between data science and non-technical stakeholders, enhancing the strategic value of data analysis.

Your journey through various roles in the data domain within FAANG companies highlights a crucial point: regardless of the position, data literacy and the ability to leverage data effectively are key differentiators. This narrative reinforces the idea that as AI evolves, the core skills that define a proficient data professionalcritical thinking, problem-solving, and storytelling with datawill remain invaluable.

Overall, your perspective suggests a future where AI enhances the field of data science by augmenting human capabilities, making data more accessible, and streamlining the communication of insights, all while emphasizing the irreplaceable value of human intuition and expertise in","7"

Its called a baseline. Feature engineering 100% improves prediction capability.

I also havent seen anything that tests for an outlier beyond looking at a univariate time series, often just using a 3stdev identification process. On a freaking time series.

That said I also see some challenges with the non-technical folks becoming too reliant on AI without the ability to troubleshoot their code or queries. But again, LLMs are pretty good at troubleshooting. 

I think well start to see a wave of the AI for data startups coming in the next 12 months. Ive already seen a few companies announce seed funding and early product access with a talk to your data positioning. 

I am particularly interested in seeing what kind of model, or models these tools will be built on. Will it be proprietary or open source, a GPT wrapper or some kind of multi modal solution? Ive been playing around a lot with GPT-4 as well as a few open source models like Llama for coding, data processing and analysis. And Im really interested to see which models will emerge as the strongest for analysing, processing, and transforming data at scale. 

I also agree about your point on storytelling. I feel this has always been important for both DA/DS but has been less of a focus in the last few years as the field has focused more and more on technical aspects like coding. It will be interesting to see what happens to DS demand + salaries in the coming years. Not saying DS is going anyway, but it seems possible that the job market could retract slightly as companies begin to integrate AI. But at the same time, I think that if the job market retracts salaries could still get a bump, as companies need to pay a premium for those DSs who have strong storytelling skills and business acumen.","15"

Do you really care about the specific claims that will occur next year? Or do you really just care about estimating the average claims amount (in dollars) that will occur?

So for example, let's say there is a skin disease we want to predict, and in the year 2022 there was an uptick in these claims due to any number of factors.

So for example, maybe the skin disease was claimed on average in 1% of dogs but in 2022 it went up to 3%.

So if this were a real life deployment on Jan 1 2022, we would train our model on all past historical data and then we would deploy the model into production for the year 2022 to make predictions.

Clearly we can expect that our model may not perform very well, because there was a change in the target distribution compared to the models available training data, so we should see that it doesn't perform very well.

If you split your test set by time, then you can simulate this error degradation that should happen. So your 2022 test set would show you that it doesn't perform very well, as it should.

However, let's say you didn't split by time and you just split randomly either iid or even stratified by dogs.

Well now, the models training set will have examples from all years including the year 2022, so it can easily learn the pattern that year 2022 = higher rate of skin disease. But this is a form of data leakage.

Now when you evaluate your model on your test set, it will show that the model has a great score.

If your test set is not in the future, then you will have data leakage in your out-of-sample error estimate.

And similarly, if your validation set is not in the future , then you will bias your model selection due to data leakage and you won't be selecting the model that best generalizes to future data.

So for those reasons, it's important to ensure your validation is in the future relative to train set, and ensure your test set is in the future relative to your validation set.","1_1_1_1_1"

So basically, your baseline model has to be limited to variables that exist in all periods.

The model will easily pick up on any other time based correlations through its features.

For example, let's say skin disease has an uptick and the percentage of golden retrievers has a downtick in the same year. Then the model will simply learn that golden retrievers are less likely to have the skin disease but that's just overfitting to the year 2022 when the breed feature was correlated with time and the target variable was also correlated by time.

For this, actuaries will typically use a GLM/GAM and assuming either a Poisson or negative binomial distribution on the response variable (e.g., that the number of observed claims is Poisson distributed with some underlying rate parameter). I do know, however, that it's not uncommon in health insurance to model it is a binary event since there is often one underlying event that leads to multiple treatments. When I have done pet insurance  in the past (covering vet expenses), this has been done with a claim frequency model, however, and that works well. I would not typically do anything to try to balance the dataset unless I just can't get the models to converge to anything sensible otherwise. When we approach this as a regression problem, rebalancing doesn't really make sense so I've never really done rebalancing during my entire time working claims data.

The main thing that you may not have thought about is that you need to handle exposure appropriately. When each row corresponds to a year, you also need to make sure you handle it appropriately when a pet drops out after 1, 3, or 6 months. This can be because of churn, the pet dying, lack of payment, or a host of other reasons. A row with one month exposure is not the same as a row with 12 months exposure (the former would have 1/12 the average number of claims of the latter, all other things being equal).

You can build boosted tree algorithms for claims data no problem, whether you approach it as a classification or regression problem. XGBoost supports Poisson for frequency, though I don't think it has support for negative binomial (and it obviously supports binary classification, but remember to handle exposure correctly). If you have claim sizes as well, you could consider modelling the whole thing using a Tweedie model (either as a GLM/GAM or using XGBoost). It can be a bit more challenging in some ways, but saves you having to make a separate claim severity model if that's on your list of things to do.","2"

Usually different models respond differently to rebalancing and the key is to properly evaluate the model. 

But to answer your question, rebalancing can expand the proportions of anomalies in the data. A common reason behind rebalancing is that some models tend to be very sensitive to sample sizes of each class and would over-sample said classes and be utterly useless in the end.

We only have budget for two campaigns per quarter, so we just needed customers divided between two segments so we can target them"". 

So, if instead of just building the model you asked ""hey, how are you going to use this?"" and they tell you ""oh, we have budget for 2 campaigns and we're trying to decide how to target two segments"" you can say ""dipstick, you don't need an entire model for that, I'll just build you something in Excel"".

MLB teams don't have a salary cap, although they do pay a ""competitive balance"" tax above certain thresholds. However, most teams aren't close to them and the penalties are relatively pretty small. For example, in 2024 the threshold will be $237M where teams pay 20% on the amount over $237M if it's their first time going over the threshold. Only 7 teams paid the tax in 2023 and only three were substantial (Dodgers, Mets, Yankees all paid over $40M, whereas the next paid only $6M). Most teams weren't anywhere close to the threshold. 

On the other hand, while he NBA salary cap rules have lots of loop holes (more so than the NFL's), most teams are near or at the salary cap. All but 10 teams this year are within $10M of the luxury tax threhold ($165.3M). The penalties are also much stiffer (e.g., the Warriors are paying over $172M in tax for going about $40M over the threshold). Consequently, NBA teams are more willing to allocate money to off-court expenses not subject to the cap, whereas for MLB teams it's more a question of whether to spend more on player or on analytics.","2_1_1"

Actual real world problems in the industry are rarely ever as simple as they are in a YouTube video. The video I think you're referring to is almost 2 hours long. Let me tell you, the vast majority of software engineers and DS couldn't write that by memory from scratch. When you actually encounter these problems in the real world, you break them down into small components and solve them individually. That's a far, far more important skill.

Now, does it help if you understand on a high level what the video is going on about? Sure. Should you be able to implement a segment of it if you do some research for a week? Sure. But I wouldn't get discouraged if you look at a 2 hour tokenisation video and half the time you don't know exactly what's going on. Very few people have that kind of in depth knowledge or memory, and you certainly don't need to know it to be successful.

2. If you are in roch with your ex-teammates, talk to them. Ask why they quit, apart from personal reasons. Now that they're out of the company they may be more open.
3. Talk to folks outside your team, in the same company. You may get information about company goals, plan, etc. Including plans for your team.

1. Since you are new to the company and your senior teammates have quit, definitely make connects within the company but outside your team. Make sure your work is known to your manager's manager and other senior team members. So even if your manager moves, you have a network within the firm.
2. Your manager may just be busy. It's even possible that they may be moving to a different, bigger, role within the firm. So all the more reason to talk and connect better with your manager. 
3. Of course, dust off your cv.

Anyways, best thing to do is first talk with your manager. Be upfront with him/her about what the future of the team is as well what he/she is planning to do. It's totally normal to ask about the landscape. For all you know, it could be attractive and lucrative for you. **DO NOT QUIT BEFORE FINDING OUT!** This is important. Don't be like these other guys and jump because everyone else is jumping. That's **dumb**. You're a data scientist, be smart!

Make whatever decision you need to make from that conversation. Personally, I wouldn't worry. Unless for some reason you hate promotions, the more people who leave, the more opportunity you have to gain a pay increase or promotion. As bad as it sounds, your boss is more than likely to give you the promotion down the road because you showed loyalty.

That being said, if you also decide to stay, just be upfront on what less resources means for you. Don't let the business shove more work on you. Actively find out if they are hiring backfills, get involved with that process, and use it to also seek advancement. Assuming you want to advance. Otherwise, just obviously make it known through your manager that if you cannot take on their work, that you need to know if the business plans to rehire them. **YOU DO NOT WANT TO BURN YOURSELF OUT!**

Knowing is half the battle. You feed off data to make recommendations. You're going to have to be a scientist now. Ask questions, then make decisions.","3"

Maybe the notebook is used for model development/prototyping, in which case you might revisit it spontaneously after coming up with some new feature ideas.  


For updating a production model, oversimplifying there are two types of updates:

* 1. Retraining/update of a fixed model specification
* 2. Updating the model specification itself (new features, hyperparameters, architecture/algo)

1 should be built into a training/deployment pipeline, not happening in a notebook. You might be automatically retraining and validating a new prod push once a week or even multiple times a day. You can do 2 in a notebook, so that would happen as often as it makes sense to explore further model development.","2"

Notebooks should probably be treated as scratch work. If something needs to be repeated frequently or programmatically you probably don't want it in that format.

Early in a models lifespan I suppose it is reasonable to have a notebook for updates and hands on data work during retraining and evaluation.

I've heard my manager (who was a software person, not data science) use the word ""greedy"" in this way before - meaning ""resource-intensive, long time, exhaustive, etc"".

But a greedy algorithm is one that is kind of the opposite.  At each step it just tries to maximize it's gain, without feeling ahead or using any other advanced technique.

I think of greedy algorithms like electrons, always taking the path of least resistance. It's greedy in the colloquial sense because you choose what's best for you at the current step of the algorithm, without looking ahead to the downstream consequences.

The software version of greedy (I think) is only caring about optimizing a single objective with no regard for efficient resource consumption. I guess you could frame that as a greedy algorithm where your utility function is univariate. Downstream consequences of running out of resources would just be ignored.

For analytics, you're expected to work more closely with the business rather than show mathematical or technical prowess, so at some point you'll most likely have to move into management. But that's just from my perspective, having been in analytics for 8 years.

Unfortunately stakeholders only realise after hiring someone that person may not ha e been the best applicant.

On the other side, if you lack technical skills, you simply won't get stuff done, or you'll stuff up more frequently and won't be able to blame anyone buy yourself.

I'll wrap my comment with saying that low / medium tier,  SE definitely pays higher. If, you are luck /skilled enough to be on the higher level, although SE roles will but handsomely, analytics roles could be even higher, due to leading to more business related pathways (cto / ceo) and, you would also be business savvy, and invaluable skill if you are thinking about starting your own business some day

Every company has a different definition of what data science is. Its very easy to spend 5+ years in this field and walk away with just the basics in a wide array of skills.Â

If youre not sure what skills you want to specialize in, another route is picking an industry to build expertise in. For example, having a strong footing in logistics made it easier for me to prioritize the easiest problems to solve with maximum benefit.Â 

From your description, it sounds like youre on the manager track. IC (individual contributor) set goals, define objectives, execute and communicate why xyz mattered in big tech. Managers at these companies basically just prioritize projects and handle internal bureaucracy.Â

I believe it. Your answer made me reflect.  


I'm learning a lot about businesses,  having the opportunity to apply machine learning, and have been collecting cases that back up that I'm able to add value through my skills in machine learning in different industries, but I won't be recognized as a specialist in any particular field.

Right now, I'm kind of a technical manager, if that even makes sense. I help with a little bit of everything, and that's been taking a toll on me because although I help with planning, 1:1s, the expectation is for me to step up and handle complicated projects, often with a tight deadline. To do that effectively, I end up studying a lot outside of regular working hours.

It's not exactly that I have an appetite for depth and only for depth, it's just that I don't want to fast-track into a managerial role early in my career, only to realize later that I can't actually deliver solutions and be stuck in a company. I'm still young and do not have that much experience, so I might be wrong, but I think that the first years of my career should be about building depth. That way, if I do transition into a pure management role down the road, I'll have the technical know-how to make informed decisions and not just play the corporate game.","6_1"

\- The work I'm doing today is teaching me about different industries, I have the opportunity to see different problems, stacks, and real machine-learning applications. This experience will be valuable to be more assertive in picking a specific DS field or industry to specialize in later on.  
  
\- It looks like startups, consultancies, and small companies prefer jacks-of-all-trades, while the higher-paying DS gigs demand specialization  


\-Even though I'm more into the technical side of ML, the nature of my current role has me on the manager track. If I want to dive deeper in the future, it seems like I'll need to specialize. That might sacrifice my growth in the current company I'm in for the opportunity to get a high-paying job where in-depth technical knowledge on a specific problem is more prized than being versatile and tackling different business issues with ML

You need to look at industries/fields where historically they've been used more sophisticated quantitative approaches. A proxy for this is to look at industries where the price of poor decisions is very costly or where the margins are very low. In insurance the cost of screwing up is pretty high, same for economic research leading to government policies, same for public health, same for medical research/pharma.   


However, I'd argue those are also the industries that is harder to sell data science to, in part because they've been doing it for so long, but also because there often is more formal qualification requirements (e.g. actuaries in insurance). Nonetheless, there's still data science application in non-core areas (in the medical space for example it's often referred as ""non-clinical"").","1_1_1_1"

This can increase model variance. Second potential issue is if you're using a tree-based model you're limited to using your new ordinal feature only one time in the tree. If you one-hot encoded you could use one of the resulting features at the top of the tree, and another down the branch.

Typically you would use target encoding for a high-cardinality feature if one-hot encoding would explode the feature space to the point that the model would be difficult to manage. If you can afford the added features I would stick to one-hot. Target encoding is a useful technique just be aware of the impact it may be having on the model you're training.","1"

Train a very simple neural net to predict your target using your categorical feature, with a single embeddings later in between.

Like with target encoding, those embeddings are limited to describing the relationship between 1 feature and 1 target.  My team generates embeddings for several combinations of common predictive features and targets that can then be applied in many other predictive models.  Here are a couple examples:

I don't think this is true. Imagine for example an two category variable that you target encode, basically the tree model will test each node if splitting between category 1 and 2 will improve the model (like a binary feature) . In the three categories case it will do the same, but it will group the middle category with the lowest or the highest.

Also, if you're just in the model development/validation stage, you should make sure you follow a similar approach to not leak the validation target values -- e.g. do the target encoding within each in-sample set when you score on the out-of-sample fold in CV.  


Target encoding can work well with proper treatment, but even when done properly the model might overfit to those features. In supervised settings, I generally trust the model to extract the right signal from categories instead of forcing it. In many modern libraries high cardinality is not an issue because there's handling for single-column categorical variables (lightgbm, neural network embeddings, etc.)","2"

The more widespread impact would be in how it transforms your feature space. Youre typically taking a fairly complex feature and mapping it to a very low dimensional space. Depending on exactly how you target-encode, that might help the model find patterns in the feature; but it could also obfuscate patterns or introduce artificial ones.

You can lose this relationship between Gmail and liking popcorn because the model will be incapable of differentiate Gmail and Hotmail users.

A good python resource would be Harvard's free online course on edx, CS50's introduction to programming with python. I have not taken this course personally, but their other course with C is pure gold, and the professor is the same for this one. The downside is that it's probably totally unrelated to data science. 

If you are not a total novice in programming and know a bit of Python, you can check out a book called thinkstats2. It's a book about statistics in python. It's free on greenteapress(dot)com. There are other related books on that website by the same author.

Important thing to remember (especially for programming, but not only) is that everything's googleable. Everything that you need is out there on the internet, and you have all the tools to find it (Google, CGPT, Gemini). Also, join communities on discord and reddit.

I started learning Data Science in 2019. Prior to this I used to make reports in excel as a full time job. Had an interview at FAANG company and realised the massive skill gap that I had. Started by watching YouTube videos to see if its my thing.

And apparently it was!! With only my experience of coding in Excel VBA, I jumped into the world of data science.

While the stats part didnt stick, I really took to Python, SQL and Tableau.

Started doing smaller projects with my mentors encouragement (I was aspiring to be on his team). Did a small proof of concept on attempting to predict hiring timelines depending on geography, skillset, grade etc. The project never saw the light of day but it was presented in many forums as our first foray into machine learning.

By this time I was good enough to watch tutorials and build working solutions out of them. Worked out how to implement Named Entity Recognition in 2 days and how to train an NER model by end of the week.

On the coming Monday Im meeting tech folks to see how we can use Apache Airflow within our area to streamline our Python based data pipelines.

The people with low CD4 counts left the sample or died before they could be sufficiently studied. 

If you want to be less technical about this, you can fit any kind of regression model with time (tenure day) as a predictor in your model.

Like statistically can we say within 3 months do they behave like a tenured employee. Because we saw good examples where employees who were successful were able to meet expectations by month three. Both quantitatively and qualitatively (MGMT)

I would say something similar could apply to you. 

That being said you need production weights, daily weights, and Weights for weeks with holidays. A perfect world has weights based on 2+ years of previous weeks where the weeks start on the same day are classified as ""similar weeks"" 

Without nice data I would compute production weights based on daily metrics for the longest tenure employee(s). It's very subjective to use them but you have to start somewhere. Each daily weight corresponds to some percentage of weekly production on a 5 day work week. 
So Monday has an average weight, different from Tuesday and so forth.

These weights will serve as the expected basis for future work.

If seasonality is a concern further weight a time period by some additional factor.

These new daily computed weights will fill in your 9-12th month. Then you can look back and see if there is any meaningfulness in the data based on shorter tenure employees who may or may not be meeting expectations. 

After you plot those individual employees performance to the new 12month standard* I would think new details will emerge. 

Also compute a population sample stdev over all days, all employees. The more data the better. Then you can use that to see if production for a particular day per employee varies against trend.

You can do a nice heat map to see who produces more and on what days. 

This is where I would start.

Edit: you need to know if overtime is being offered. If it is you need to scale the weights based on a normal shift length if you know hours worked by each employee per day you can easily scale this.","3"

So the variance between employee production can be explained by a litany of factors:overtime, experience, day of the week, and number of days worked that week. My attempt above should capture most of those. All be it in a limited fashion given your lack of data.

Now with enough data we could even find out, by gender, by ethnicity, by socioeconomic status, and by commute time.

The second set of data points are quite frankly no factors we can control for not should we as they are either illegal or immoral. So there will always be confounding variables that explain the variance between employees.

One additional point I'd like to make is that most of what are referred to as AI approaches, require very high sample sizes to shine, and in a lot of clinical trial settings, sample sizes are small. For instance:

* In a [recent paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.9931?af=R) Infante et al. (2023) confirm (again) that for survival outcomes, the sample size necessary for ML models is significantly higher than traditional models: ""*random forests requires at least 150% more than the minimum sample size suggested for traditional regression models, while neural networks requires about 200% the minimum sample size*"". Other papers had shown that in most scenarios it's difficult to beat the workhorse model (Cox PH).

* In a [recent paper](https://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/dbds/documents/biostats-workshop/paper-1-.pdf), Efron writes: ""*Evidently there are a great many genes weakly correlated with prostate cancer, which can be combined in different combinations to give near-perfect predictions. This is an advantage if prediction is the only goal, but a disadvantage as far as attribution is concerned. Traditional methods of attribution operate differently, striving as in Table 1 to identify a small set of causal covariates (even if strict causality cannot be inferred)*"". Which translated means it would be more difficult to explain to regulators why they should trust results from these models, since they care more about attribution than prediction (see hero_pup and relevantmeemayhere answers).

* Significant skepticism among scientists exists on personalized medicine. Not an expert on this, but the experts whose judgment I value, have spoken less than positively about it. 

With that being said, we are seeing areas where AI approaches seem to bring some value such as diagnostic imaging, even though there are still significant challenges ahead. Patient recruitment could be another area. And who knows, LLMs may help in expediting some of the more regulatory work, kinda like we use LLM as personal assistant today.","9"

I don't know if smart metering in its original sense ever became a thing in many locations. As far as I know, the original thought behind smart metering was that the meter should control the behaviour of the devices consuming the power behind the meter. 

But I think that part of smart metering has been left in the dust by a new reality where most of the power hungry devices are being connected to the internet individually and are being controlled by other means, for example a price signal. So the role of the ""smart meter"" today is mostly to provide the necessary data for hourly billing at variable prices.

I think the Danish datasets have some potential for exploring the behavioural effects of smart metering, as in ""variable electricity price"". I don't know if it was something like that, you had in mind?

To explain this in more detail:

In Denmark, all household electricity meters are logging consumption on a 15 or 60 minute basis. The last meters without this capability were replaced in 2020. In my own household, I can see hourly data back to 2014.

Until 2020, those data went almost unused. Almost all costumers paid the same price per kWh all day.

Around 2020, the country started changing towards variable transport tariffs. Those are non-voluntary, and solely depends on which grid company you are attached to, and what type of consumer you are (housholds and some different categories of business consumers). Today, 98-99% of all Danish households pay a variable transport tariff, divided into 2 or 3 fixed transport prices over each 24 hour period. The variability of this transport tariff is rather high, compared to the total electricity price. In my case, the difference between my transport tariff at night and in the afternoon is around 0.12 Â¬/kWh. In other parts of the country, this difference is as high as 0.26 Â¬/kWh. 

On top of this, a lot of consumers are on a power plan, where the price of electricity excluding transport and tax will follow the spot market price hour by hour. My guess is that somewhere between 50 and 75% of all consumers are on these plans. Over the last week, this part of my electricity price has varied between 0.00 and 0.18 Â¬/kWh, and that was actually a period with stable prices. On some days we have negative prices in the cheapest hours, and on some days we have prices of 0.50 Â¬/kWh in the most expensive hours. From memory, the absolute records during the last few years were around -0.50 Â¬/kWh and 0.80 Â¬/kWh.

The above numbers should be seen in the context of a total electricity price of around 0.20-0.30 Â¬/kWh including transport and tariffs, when averaged over all hours in a month. So the total hourly variations in price actually exceed the total average price a lot of the time. And yes, we do have had hours, where our total electricity price was negative.

Because of all this, I think there may be a valid data science project in exploring how this change from a fixed price to variable prices has affected the consumption numbers. Is it possible to quantify how smart metering has moved consumption from expensive hours to cheap hours?

Disclaimer: I am engineer, not a data scientist. So you should treat my words of ""a valid data science project"" as pure guesswork.","1_1_1"

A straightforward starting point might be to establish a linear regression model based on the KPIs, which would allow you to measure the deviation of current values from those predicted by the model. The coefficients (betas) from this model could offer insights into what factors are influencing changes in the predicted values. To enhance the model's accuracy, you could consider adjustments for seasonality, or employing more sophisticated models, among other improvements.

Alternatively, instead of constructing a model at an aggregated level, you might consider developing models at an individual level. For instance, rather than predicting an overall click rate, you could use individual user data to predict their specific clicking behavior. This approach allows for a detailed analysis of whether changes in user's or there are other variables could explain fluctuations in overall click rates.","6"

Part of it is we dont want to deal with states with stupid and highly limiting employment laws like California, or sell in places with insane requirements like Europe.  As a billion dollar company with no debt, no shareholders, and incredible organic growth from being so nimble, why would we ever think about tarnishing our reputation with our customers and vendor partners?

Being able to pick and choose where we do business to avoid stupid regulations is great.  Being able to spend what we need on some cool new project to create value for the business is amazing.

Theres also no need to hire globally when you have a super lean IT department that understands the principle of teams of 4 to 6 being ideal, and those teams reporting directly to the CIO or CISO or some other executive.  We can plan our new hires properly and onboard them when it suits our needs while taking the time to properly develop relationships and ensure the new hire is fully trained and ready to contribute after the first six months.

Stable and happy teams are incredibly important and it results in highly efficient and effective teams that produce amazing things.  We enjoy working with each other, and get together at the corporate office at least quarterly for planning and engineering sessions, and we bring our families with in the summer for a company picnic and bring our spouses with in the winter for the big holiday party at the resort lodge.  Most of us are within comfortable driving distance and others get a flight and a hotel.

Even though Im only 15 minutes away from the office, I love the lack of a commute, the comfort of my own home office with my standup desk and my own kitchen and bathroom, and the extra time Incan spend with my wife and kids throughout the day.  I have a team that covers for each other when we have family events, whether planned or not.

It sounds to me like you dont understand the importance of fantastic culture and the freedom for your team to work the way they need and want.  I did what youre doing in the past, and learned there are much better options.  Startups can be incredibly unstable and massive corporations tend to have so much unnecessary overhead and waste.  You should try a privately held midsize billion dollar company&just the right size, and no shareholders to please.  We pretty much get left alone to build cool stuff that creates value and profits for the business, and we dont have to deal with dysfunctional office politics or terrible team members who suck to work with or some middle micro manager who knows nothing about what we do.

There are no huge DS-specific secrets here. Be generally good at your work and set boundaries as well as long-term (job-related) goals. One complements the other.

Explanation:

1. Be good at it. You don't have to be a super-star, but be able to assess a situation and deliver a good product. It will also allow you to stop unreasonable demands. And, obviously if you are good at something, you get satisfaction you did a good job.
2. Setting boundaries. 60h+ weeks? Sorry, I can't do for multiple reasons. Family, friends, health, etc. Meeting at 07:30? Only if I wake up next to you. Stick to your principles. I occasionally work very long hours (60h+) but that is at crucial times when my 70h will have really impact on our work, not because someone sent an e-mail 3 hours ago thinking a detailed report on a specialist subject can be produced by COP today.
3. Have long-term goals. Sometimes the job task are uninspiring. Spark call timed-out? Dashboard renders in black-and-white suddenly? API spits out in None instead of Int? A. See point 1. B. if these ""boring"" tasks don't align with your long-term goals, they suck and your job sucks too. You don't need a 5-year plan, but have some goals that you like and help you have a broader appreciation of why you do things.
4. Bonus point: Work with competent and polite people. Self-explanatory. Hard to achieve, but you can slowly gravitate towards them.","2"

We're hired by companies that want to improve the health of their patients/insureds, or improve the way that they understand the health of their patients/insureds. 

I love my job. I work a lot by choice but my manager isn't insistent that we work &gt;40-45 hours per week. I get to work on a lot of cool projects and present at conferences. My experience may not be the common one, but I'm not anywhere close to hating my job.

The main difficulty for me is managing timelines because I want to ship out clean, efficient, organized code and want to test every possibility under the sun to see if there's a way that we can improve our offerings or if there are better ways to answer clients' data questions (or to come up with questions and answers that they didn't even know to ask). 

At the end of the day, consultants are expensive. We need to do what the client asks in the least amount of time that we can -- and if there is extra stuff that we want to do, we can ask them if they're interested in using the rest of the estimated budget for that. Luckily, they usually agree, and we get to try out cool stuff.","3"

1. They are not for people looking for depth. If you want to become a specialist with deep, deep knowledge in some area of DS, this isn't it. But if you're someone who is a generalist - who in turn would probably struggle in a job that does require depth, this can be a good fit.
2. The goal for DSs in consulting isn't to become like prinicpal data scientists. It's to become a consulting manager/director with a focus on DS. And if you work in consulting, your path to becoming DS leadership is much faster. 
3. They generally pay very well compared to everyone except tech.

Now, this doesn't generally apply to tech jobs, this applies to basically all other jobs. But that's an important distinction in that tech salaries are so much higher than everything else that it is often better to be a Sr. DS at a FAANG than it is to be a Director at a traditional company. But again, not everyone can make their way into a FAANG - nor likes the FAANG work - and for those people this provides an alternative fast tracked path into leadership.","8"

You'll get really dumb projects you'll have to execute on sometimes.  Some things will be rewarding and fun and you'll feel like you're having an impact (though you may not be).

Another very famous Professor told me to take MCMC course as the industry is starting to realize the power of this approach. I did but I still haven't found a single job posting that asks of such knowledge but maybe such things are asked from seniors

  
I asked another Professor what I could study from statistics on my own during summer break and he told me that I can't study statistics on my own because it is very hard.

I asked another Professor how different is the approach to time series is compared to tabular data and at the end of the conversation I realized while he understands what transformations of data are he has no idea what the phrase ""feature engineering"" or even kaggle is.

One red flag I see however is that you have to first forecast your exogenous variables!

Ideally an encryption algorithm converts to a space where everything looks like random noise, and imparting additional structure on that space corresponds to a weaker encryption. You need to minimize that structure if possible.


One potential policy, especially if youre trying to generate complex datasets for test cases without synthesizing it all by hand, is to start with a traditional encryption for the data at rest. Then when you need to create a test set, select off a small and minimal subset, decrypt it like you normally would, pass it through your homomorphic encryption with a single-use key, and discard the key without ever recording it. The idea is to prevent any single homomorphic dataset from being large enough for someone to find useful patterns and reverse the encryption, and it minimizes the blast radius if they do. Done correctly, it renders the original data irrecoverable, so the homomorphic copy is no longer quite so sensitive.


Itll also be important that details about your algorithm are privileged information that stays inside the company. You dont want people to know what structure youre preserving because that tells attackers what patterns to look for.","4"

Some patterns might be preserved by the encryption, in which case an attacker might be able to make guesses about which subgroups are which. Domain knowledge about the original space can weaken the encryption significantly more than the arithmetic alone might indicate. This is another reason why I suggest minimizing the size of homomorphic datasets. It increases signal to noise ratios in the original data, so its less likely anything useful ends up in the homomorphic data.","4_1"

If you can package up ingestion, warehousing, modelling, BI and some DA/DS in a way that derisks the potential for failed deliverables people might buy it. The open ended nature of DS as well as the lack of data maturity in orgs that dont yet in-house means start up time is long, and justifying ROI is hard. 


I worked at a Data Science Consultancy, realistically we did: 
1) 2 months of data ingestion and modelling 
2) 2 months of BI and some fairly generic insights based off the data models. 
3) after this wed potentially get on to some DS (ML, statistical analysis) or even some well structured data analytics beyond dashboards. 

We worked with Series A - C start ups, and generally what I found was that they valued the definitive outputs of 1 and 2 as they could clearly ascribe price to deliverables. 3 was more open ended and bore some risk there wouldnt be anything there, and this made it hard to justify costs. Wed often plan for 8-12 month engagements, only to end at 6 with most clients because they were ready to hire internally (all obviously looking for the DS unicorn), or they had some core reporting that now solved their needs.","2"

If youre going in to a series B App, doing DS whilst theyve got no data team in place, youre more likely to be tasked with getting their marketing reporting, and some user reporting in place. 

If you go into a more established company thats got a data team or at least warehouse in place, you might work on some LTV predictions, or lead scoring.

If your goal is to move to another country then I'd say your best option is to first see if you can get hired in a ChE + DS role in another country. But I think getting hired as a foreigner is usually difficult. So I'd say that, while you're applying for jobs, also apply for grad school and use your MS/PhD as an entry point into that country you want to move into. If cost is an issue, there are many MS scholarships and PhD positions are almost always funded.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Will fully transitioning to DS be a good choice? i think its a risky move as ill be competing with cse/cs/stats grads who are already buffed up to begin with, which makes me much even more unlikely to get selected.

Someone correct me if I am wrong but I think this difficulty applies more to non-entry level roles or if your background is not in science/engineering. I have several colleagues who got into entry level DS positions with a BS in Chem. I think the more important question here is if you want to be a ChE + DS or focus on DS (at a different domain). I'd say, apply for both positions that look for ChE + DS and for general DS positions and go from there.","5"

There's a difference between leading people, leading products, and leading strategy. If you're targeting management or leading people, you can learn that from A or B just as well. Strategy doesn't come into the picture until VP and C-level leadership roles. Product strategy is a different role altogether (product manager). Long-term, every IC picks product, strategy, or leadership (technical or people). The first two have more jobs because leadership is flattening in most businesses so there aren't as many director and VP roles anymore.","2"

Similar to how I advise people to NOT spend all your time in one piece of technology (e.g.: being the Oracle DBA guy), learning other domains is useful down the road if you find your domain is slow.

For one great example, I work in the video game industry. Our industry has seen massive layoffs last months. Roughly about 10,000 people lost their jobs. When I looked on LinkedIn at the time, there was maybe 400 jobs for the game industry on a generic search. Having that additional domain experience helps in situations like that so you can pivot until more roles open up down the road. This on top of the fact other industries can bring new ideas to the industry you love.

PhD student at UChicago astrophysics. I genuinely love doing research and love my discipline a lot, but for personal life reasons, I am considering transitioning to industry down the line. 

I aim to intern for a data science research role in Summer '26 and convert that to a full-time offer. Relocating to the Bay Area would be ideal. I don't necessarily care a ton about company name/ prestige/ pay as long they are reasonable; willing to work hard to move up the ladder. 

I know it's a couple years away, but I'd like to start early. Some background info -  

1. Computer Science - I have extensive programming experience in Python (scripting/ Jupyter). Have about six research projects that I've programmed entirely by myself. My PhD thesis work is neatly contained into libraries under version control. I took OOP in C++/ Algorithms and Time Complexity (proof-based) and did quite well in those CS classes. Have experience with parallelization through research projects. Also have working knowledge of bash commands etc.

2. Statistics - I deal with noisy data from telescopes all the time, and compare measurements with observables predicted from simulations I run. Common techniques I interact daily with are parameter fitting using MCMC, regression with uncertain/ censored data, hypothesis testing, PCA. I have done a few short-term projects combining ML with astronomy/ biophysics, so I have a working knowledge of ML (MLP, CNNs, Gaussian Processes), but not cutting-edge. 

3. Math - well-versed with linear algebra, differential equations/ PDEs, multivariate calculus, discrete math.

4. Project Management - I led satellite operations for a NASA based mission for three years during undergrad, developed infrastructure for the mission and oversaw/ trained three generations of operations.

5. Writing/ communication - am currently working on at least two first-author publications. Have TA'd undergraduate STEM courses for four academic quarters.

I know there's a lot I need to polish/ learn to be competitive for roles given the current market, but I was hoping somebody could point out helpful things to focus on for prep. I've started doing Kaggle for instance and plan on participating in the Citadel Datathon this coming Fall - would these be helpful pursuits? I am aware that my knowledge of version control/ SWE stack is currently laughable, so I'd need to polish those a lot more.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I apologize in advance for my naivete, I have never had an industry job and have always been part of the academic pipeline, so I'm very new to this. I am coming here because my research online has not yielded coherent advice for somebody in my position (i.e. a PhD student) concerning what kind of roles I should aim for/ what I should focus on for my prep.","3"

Another option once you get up in price, and if you can take the time commitment, is to go full time.

Certification matters only if you want to test and showcase your skills in the interview with HR (not data experts).

Math wise Im comfortable with basic algebra but my calculus needs a refresher and I am not very comfortable with linear algebra or differential equations. Im working through some Coursera data science math courses to fix this.

In my work I started off as just a bench top scientist then worked my way into a project team. I then decided I wanted to add some data centric skills since I am pretty competent with computers and my company has been pushing scientists to get more data analytic skills. I wanted to see if I liked that type of work so sought out people in my department who did that work. I started working with our departments dashboard guy to learn how they made and setup our dashboards. I liked what we did and the thinking we had to do to solve data problems was fun. Unfortunately they got promoted out of the department before the finished teaching me and the dashboards ownership was up in the air since nobody had been lined up to takeover the responsibility. At the same time the dashboards they made broke. Which is were my plan starts from.

My plan:


1. Take over responsibility for the dashboarding of my department. Which gives me a connection to our departments data scientist.Â 
2. Fix the issues with the broken dashboardsÂ 
3. Create better dashboards since I have the understanding of how users wants to see their data presentedÂ 
4. Put together a small team of junior scientists that have an interest in dashboarding and teach them enough to be effective at making and maintaining dashboards. So we have a pool of people to pull from for bigger projects.Â 
5. Â Complete the bigger projects that the previous person didnt get to with my team.
6. Join a modeling project within my department while relearning/learning the math on off hours
7. Use my previous work as justification to get tuition reimbursement for a masters in Data scienceÂ 
8. Complete my masters and move into a data scientist role within the same company or have another company pay back the debt I would owe by leaving early.Â

I've been navigating this challenging job market for a couple of months now and am seeking advice or insights on refining my job search strategy. Despite applying to nearly 140 positions since December, my success rate has been low, with only 3 screening calls and no solid offers yet.

**Background:**

* **Experience:** Nearly 3 years as a Data Scientist at a large automotive company where I worked on a near daily basis with Python, Spark, and HiveQL. I did *some* ML stuff such as categorical clustering (behavioral attributes for marketing audiences), decision tree classifier (used for root cause analysis on engine malfunction using diagnostic codes), and some other more statistical stuff (i.e. anomaly detection on important data pipelines going to other companies/orgs).
* **Education:** Recently completed MSc in a computational science type program abroad (in Germany but now back in the US), including a thesis project training and optimizing an NN classifier.
* **Current Strategy:** Applying to jobs via LinkedIn with tailored T-style cover letters for positions allowing it.

**Considerations:**

* **Cloud Computing:** Lacking experience in this area - my company had/rented their own HPC with Hadoop and was only just beginning a transition to GCP when I left - so I'm contemplating earning an AWS Solutions Architect certification or something similar.
* **Side Project:** Considering starting a project involving AWS, NLP, and automation to showcase my skills. It's something with a real use-case and not just some Kaggle project and so while it's not perfectly tailored to what I might need it is a little more authentic.

**Questions:**

1. Should I prioritize gaining specific skills like cloud computing over increasing my application volume?
2. Would a focused side project potentially make me a more attractive candidate?
3. Any other strategies or adjustments you'd recommend based on your experiences?

I appreciate any advice or shared experiences that could help steer my approach in a more fruitful direction. Thanks!","23"

I work as a data analyst and my job is kind of moving into AI and wanting to do DS/ML. I want to move into more DS where I'm working R ideally - I much prefer R over Python. 
I'm currently on the OMSCS part, not the GT Analytics graduate program so that may be why I don't like it but I want the cs recognition (does that really matter anymore as data science careers/jobs has grown more and more over the years?)

I just feel like OMSCS courses are more busy work where you kind of learn something throughout (taking an AI course rn), but I saw Eastern had 7 week semesters so I was initially interested in it because of that.","29_1_1"

Take the research assistant position and make sure you understand why the methodologies are being selected. You would not believe the number of applicants who can not explain projects on their own resumes and why steps were taken. 

Spend some time in the summer and review some easy leet code. This is not to grind them but to practice walking interviewers through your thought process and how that corresponds to code. Almost all data science interviews that I have been in or have given will eventually have some type of coding component. 

Use career services to look over your resume. Then come August start looking for internships. Fall recruiting seems to keep getting earlier and earlier each year. Generally by Thanksgiving, fall recruiting will be over. 

Hopefully the internship you land turns into a full time return offer which is a great high to have coming into your final year of undergraduate.","30_1"

I'm planning to continue working full-time, so the options I'm assessing are mostly part-time and online programs. The fields I'm looking at are data analytics, data science, data engineering, and bioinformatics. Here are some of the programs I'm considering:  
  
\- Harvard Extension School - Data Science  
\- Northeastern University x Coursera - Data Analytics Engineering  
\- BU Metropolitan College - Health Informatics  
\- Brandeis (online) - Bioinformatics  
\- Johns Hopkins University (online) - Bioinformatics or Data Science

1. In terms of respect from employers (or ""prestige"" I guess), how does Harvard Extension School compare to a non-extension school from a ""lesser"" university? I've had some people say the Harvard name beats all (extension or not), and others who say it's better to get a degree somewhere else that doesn't have a built-in debuff.

The online does not appear on the diploma from what I understand. 


I'm in my first semester and taking a ""medium"" level course just to get me back into the groove of things for school. I'm taking an AI course right now. I would say choose your classes (if you go CS route) carefully, you could get an ""easy"" CS Master's and only take one or two harder courses. I would say for someone who works 40 hours a week it can difficult to find time to the do the work. Currently every week there is some sort of code, writing assignment, and peer feedbacks due. 
OSMA has more business classes like management of IT and stuff like that. But OMSCS and OSMA share a lot of the classes (OMSCS has a machine learning or iteractive intelligence specialization. I'm doing the interactive one since I don't have to take an algorithms course). One other difference is in OSMA you have to do an internship or implement what you learned in the program in a work related project (which is why OSMA is more expensive). For OMSCS you just take the 10 courses and you graduate, although they do have a course you can take where you publish a paper. 


 
It depends mainly on what courses you are interested in tbh. I have interest in NLP, ML, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning which the last 3 are some of the harder courses at GT since they go very indepth. 

I chose OMSCS because I like the computer science name (more broad if unable to get a DS job) but I am thinking about going to a diff school. In my opinion, I feel like they fluff up some of the courses for busy work.

I am a professor writing a letter or recommendation for a student. These are the strengths of this student. 1), 2), & Can you writing an initial draft of a letter of recommendation I can build upon?

[ChatGPT writes a draft]

[You edit it and add more text/detail as needed]

Example 2:

I am a data scientist that specializes in X responding to a question of Y. I need to provide a detailed reply to this question asked in an email. [Provide those details]. Could you draft an easy to read response to this email please?

[ChatGPT provides a draft]

[You revise, correct and add detail]

Here is what I built up on your response, can you help proof and finalize this email response please?

Both of these are excellent examples where ChatGPT does the grunt work, while you are doing the intellectual work. Both save massive amounts of time, especially in the proof reading stage.

The key thing is that you need to prompt ChatGPT as to its role in writing. Generally, ChatGPT struggles with facts and details, while it excels at structuring writing very well. If you provide the details, it can do the hard part of structuring your details into a much easier to read format. If you edit what it provides, it gets even better.

Note, this assumes a paid ChatGPT account. The free accounts seem to have major limits in doing these tasks effectively.

Both of these highlight tasks that need to be done well, but take a LOT of time todo. Working with ChatGPT saves time in developing *effective* communication.

Also, this is for Dept heads, but if you can code in Python, you can automate these tasks so you dont need to copy/paste text.","3"

It is difficult to say more without some domain knowledge of the problem and whether a data drift of that magnitude makes sense in that dataset.

Also depends on how large the datasets are. If train and test sets are only 200 rows, then it could just be random variance in small sample sizes that causes such a change.

I agree with you that AUCROC makes the most sense here as a metric to optimize without any further information of the cost of FP vs FN.

One thing that might help is to use a rolling time series CV where you shift the test set period multiple times and average across those.

But my biggest concern is that the distribution shift is due to data collection issues/bugs which would make the test set invalid. But you're in a tough spot since it's a static test that you have no control over.","1"

I would say that it's probably just difficult this way. Though I'm surprised your tree based method performed worse than a linear method. It's quite likely that you are overfitting with the tree methods, and if you use a smaller hyperparameter search grid and also smaller values for num_leaves and max_depth then you will probably see a decrease in train/valid scores but an improvement in test score.

&gt;And good point I can in a way calculate the cost of a FP or FN but I think from a ML perspective, shouldnt you want the classifier with the best AUC ROC and then you can pick the threshold that will fit your business needs with FP / FN?

It depends on the cost of your FP and FN! 

In some cases, the cost of FP or FN is dynamic and changes for each sample! For example if you're predicting the churn of a business customer, then a FN for large business customers will have higher cost than a FN for a smaller customer that doesn't generate as much revenue for us.

In that case, it's not just about AUCROC because it doesn't take into account the specific costs of each individual sample. 

But even in cases where the cost of FP and FN are constant, then you could imagine a scenario where one model has worse AUCROC but better cost.

Here's an example: Imagine the cost of FP is 0 and the cost of FN is greater than 0. 

In that case, the optimal model is to simply predict True for all samples and that will give you the lowest possible cost. However you can see that this is not the optimal model from an AUCROC perspective.","1_1_1"

Trees tend to struggle with ""extrapolation"" and instances where data on a biplot would be linearly seperable with a diagonal.   
This can be overcome by taking the sums/diffs/ratios/prods of the top variables.  
  
There's also cases where there might be a feature that might need to be engineered/added. Think adding ""gift card amount"" or ""store credit amount"" for a retail business, or time since 2nd most recent use for a streaming service.   


I generally suggest XGB or RF with 0 hyper parameter tuning for exploration just because they're hard to mess up (LR can be finicky and overfits easily.)  


In most cases feature engineering and selection should be seen as a more important. XGB with trash hyperparameters but a variable that on its own explains 90% of outcome variance will outdo a perfectly tuned model trained on random numbers.","1_1_1_1"

Your model has to be driven by hypothesis of stakeholders. Attrition is different at every firm but usually key stakeholders will have a good idea as to why people leave. Accessing exit interview data also helps.

For example at one of my clients, a lot of people mentioned the lack of a career ladder. So we added a variable to track tenure in current role, and saw that once someone spent 2+ years in their role, their attrition likelihood would skyrocket. Indicating people already know at that point they will be stalling in their careers.

But this will vary company by company and its your job as a DS to parse our the key information from the stakeholders.

Time series models to predict attrition rarely work. Weve had the most success with CATBoost (since youre likely going to be dealing with a lot of categorical variables) and survival analysis.

It also depends on how many employees there are. Unless you have 5k+ employees YoY, you might want to stay away from doing ML.

And a lot of the most powerful features will be categorical. Tree-based methods likely good, catboost sounds good.

A lot of the features OP will want will be super-highly-incredibly sensitive (e.g. are they going to give you performance review data? because that's very likely predictive), others will not be tracked (e.g. amount of direct interaction with manager and higher management is likely predictive, but not tracked). So discovery will be important.

To OP's need, for forecasting future attrition rates, as long as it is not super far in future (and super far in future, likely will not be accurate anyway), just do it based on aggregation across individual-level probabilities. If you know person A is 5% likely to leave in 3 months, person B 8%, person C 2%, that will give what you want, or close enough that with some transformation you can get there.

Also very important to understand is if the goal is simply to predict attrition or understand what is driving attrition. (in the end state, do higher-ups want to understand the causal drivers?

You will create derivatives of t, like t-squared, that will help you to fit the nonlinearity of the survival curves over t

Once you are through with all that please remember you don't have to build to build the perfect model, and often some model is better than none.

The empirical design should be optimised before data acquisition. (Guided by sorted and contrasted hypotheses). Measurements are always taken as contrasts to guarantee normality and primarily to remove confounds.

If there are many/enough factors and repetitions, then take into account the information in the experimental design itself, by predicting the outcome without measurements, based on the conditions and their order. The business situation is likely to predict outcomes to a certain degree.

If you do not find confounds there: Check the true distribution of the chance levels. The chance level depends on the computational methods, not mathematical estimations.

Take an event related analysis design, if the data permits it.

To check the results you could employ a scheme to fit predictors both ways (as formalized in directional transfer entropy).

Report the results in their own distribution (if permutation tests are viable). And the average and median effects.","6"

You are trying to do something typically called causal inference. You want to understand how changes to variable X (deaths) will cause an effect on the variable Y (outcome of match).

But you can't really do that with observational data with the method you're proposing because you didn't get to control for and randomize the X variable!

At best, the SHAP value will help to tell you about the correlation between your variable and your target.

Think of it like this: Imagine you are building a model to predict who is going to survive in a hospital and you give it variables like a person's age and gender and whether they are currently in intensive care or not.

After you train this model to predict who's likely to die, you might look at the shap graph for the feature ""is patient in ICU"" and you might see that going into the ICU actually increases your chances of dying! Which is strange, because why are we sending people to the ICU in the first place if it makes them worse?

The answer is that the ICU doesn't cause people to be more likely to die. It's just that the really sick people go to the ICU, so the model will simply learn the predictive correlation pattern that being in the ICU means a higher probability of dying soon because of unknown confounding factors.

So if you get at what I'm saying, that's why analyzing SHAP graphs for models trained on observational uncontrolled data is not likely to be very useful or insightful in the ways you would like it to be.

EDIT: For clarification, you can perform causal inference on observational data but not by training an ML model on it and observing the SHAP graphs. It's an entirely different process where you need put all assumptions into a graph of causality and control for all possible confounders. I suggest The Book of Why for more info","1"

Take your ICU example. If I invent the concept of the ICU and then randomly assign patients to it, I'll get the effect of ICU on patient chances of dying and find it to reduce the death rate.

If I use an existing ICU and measure the effect of X on Y then I'll find it increases deaths like you say. However, I know enough about healthcare to be aware of the confounder of sickness. If I measure the effect of ICU on death rate whilst controlling for patient acuity in some way, I'll find the reduction in deaths.

You can do casual inference on observational data, you just need to have a strong belief you've collected the data you need to control for all confounders. That's a big assumption which is why RCTs are the gold standard but OP may well have measured all confounders.","1_1"

This is only true if you perfectly control for ALL known and unknown confounders.

This would mean you have to measure ALL types of sicknesses and degrees and ensure there is not a single variable missing that could be a confounder, etc.

I'd suggest ""The Book of Why"" for a further background.

You can't just control for all other variables and call it a day.

Also to clarify, my comment was talking about using SHAP graphs of an ML model trained on observational data to infer causal relationships. That's not really possible as far as I'm aware. You can drop the SHAP/ML part and try to use other methods by controlling for all confounders.

But again, the problem is that you can't just control for all variables. You need to control for the PERFECT exact set of correct confounding factors.

If you accidentally control for a non-confounder then that would invalidate the results entirely. Which funnily makes causal inferencebon observational data kind of a chicken or egg problem: You need to assume all of the confounders and causal relationships in order to even be able to infer causality. So you often end up with ""results"" that you can't validate for correctness and you just have to hope it's correct lol.

TL;DR: You can perform causal inference on observational data but I wouldn't recommend it because it rarely works well in practice and is extremely difficult to validate or confirm its correctness. Especially for somebody like OP who seems new to DS in general.","1_1_1"

This is true but markedly less of an issue than it would be if controlling for any non-confounding variable was a problem.

Secondly, you can't use SHAP but you canuse asymmetric Shapley values for this kind of analysis.


Finally, you mentioned in your other comment that this is all impossible to verify so who would use it. I agree that it's unverified but in practice this is often still useful because:

- Obtaining RCT validation data is cheaper than obtaining training and validation data if you must verify it

&gt;- Obtaining RCT validation data is cheaper than obtaining training and validation data if you must verify it 

Totally agree! I would be super happy if somebody was going to run causal inference on an observational dataset and only planned to use it after validating with a set of RCT validation data.

The problem I was pointing out is that 99% of people that try to use causal inference never do that imo. That's just my experience.

I rarely see people who run CI on observational data that later actually validate the results with an RCT. But if that's the actual plan then I totally support it!

&gt; - Data science is often about making better adverts or whatever. The risk is way less than drug trials where RCTs are a must and as a result a half decent causal model is usually worth trying out. It's usually better than no model!

I definitely agree in some respect! DS problems are not often as life or death as medical trials.

However, I'm not sure if I agree that it's usually better than no model.

If you plan to run CI on observational data and not validate it with any RCT, then I would disagree.

Again, I think it's like training a model with only a training set and never using any validation or test set. Maybe it's a good model, or maybe it's a horribly bad model.

I wouldn't necessarily say any model is better than no model.

In my experience, when people run CI on observational data, they are just trying to gather insights that will justify the pre-determined business strategy. Execs will just use the information that confirms the strategy they already wanted to go with.

So for all those reasons, I think running CI on observational data without any RCT for validation is a big waste of time in 99% of cases. It doesn't provide any value or new actionable information.

Totally agree with this and it was a mix up of terminology on my part.

However, the problem still remains that you need to understand all causal descendants of your treatment.

So in OP's case, they cannot control for any causal descendants of ""in game deaths"". But how could OP even do that? I would bet that almost every feature in their dataset is a causal descendant of in game deaths during the match.

See what I'm getting at? I'm sure there are some cases in real life where the causal graph is simple and straight forward.

But for most real life problems, it's horribly complex AND unknown to begin with so the best we can do is make rough assumptions and hope for the best. Which I think often leads to ""insights"" that are just fodder for justifying upper management's predetermined business strategies.","1_1_1_1_2"

How would splitting by ICU and analyzing OTHER features shap graphs help at all?

Also at the end of the day, if you only have observational data, you have to make a lot of assumptions and create a causal graph and use that to infer. You can read ""The Book of Why"" if you are curious to learn more.

But even if you do all that, SHAP graphs will not help.

The example was just to help show you that correlation is not the same thing as causation.

It has nothing to do with life or death situations, etc.

I'm just telling you that the SHAP graphs are completely meaningless on the dataset you are talking about.

You can analyze the SHAP graph for the deaths feature, and maybe it says it is ""good"" for winning the game or maybe it says it is ""bad"". But you have no idea if it's true or not! It could be the opposite in reality, and if you try to decrease deaths then it would actually worsen your chances of winning even though you thought it was the opposite!

It's not about 99% accuracy, it's about having 0% accuracy. You have no clue if the model is correct or not. You might as well just make a random guess and say ""close enough"" because it might randomly be correct.

It's basically a random guess, which is not insightful or useful. You are basically just looking at correlations and then making up stories of how it should be interpreted. It will not be helpful really IMO.","1_2_1_1_1"

You can definitely perform some more traditional causal inference where you build a graph of causality where you assume all of the causal relationships and plug that into a model to compute causal inferences.

But one, that's very different and doesn't involve SHAP or ML models directly.

Second, there's lots of caveat and issues with that method. It's very prone to giving incorrect and misleading results if you don't have the exact correct set of assumptions. It also can be completely invalid if you aren't measuring all of the important confounding factors.

That's the biggest issue with causal inference. You basically need to know all of the possible confounding factors and observe and control for them.

But it's kind of like a chicken or egg problem. We want to run causal inference studies to understand the causal relationships. But we need to know the structure of the causal relationships first and input those as assumptions for the methods to work on observational data.

Not with people in the ICU, that's your treatment variable that you're trying to measure the effect of but you could segment your data by patient health status.

Grouping your patients by some measure of how catastrophically sick they are and then measuring effect of ICU on outcome within groups will find ICU helps.

The question is what variables affect your chances of winning the game and did you measure them all?

For example, I could imagine tiredness causing in game deaths and overall defeats. If you've measured that somehow then you could include it. If you haven't, you'll find more deaths make you more likely to lose but really some of that will just be because tiredness makes you more likely to die and to lose.

In the beginning, projects will be purely for satisfying our own curiosity and learning. I think, creating a website and posting results of some of our more interesting projects would be good to, just to have something in our portfolio and keep us motivated. Experiment with ML a little bit, since we are interested in that. Later on, though, we would like to transition to something that's not only interesting to us, but also useful to other people as well. Find some freelance work on Upwork and such platforms after we are confident and have some experience.

We don't plan to do this for money, at least for now. Doing such projects seem like a reward in itself, as we will have to learn and research some interesting topics. The most important part seems to be coming up with projects that we actually care about, but we are 4 curious guys, so I think we will manage on that front.I know that I am idealizing a lot here and things won't be as simple as I made them seem.

She does not want to or need to be introduced to any bit of mathematics like most courses do: ""Hey, this is a tensor, but you can think of it being a really big table"" is just wasted time for her as she clearly has a very good image of a tensor already.

Could you help me kick-start her into the field?

I graduated in June 2023 with a CompSci degree and have been looking for a job mostly in software engineering but have yet to find one due to the market and going to a pretty unknown university.

My university had a BS in Data Science that just started as I was graduating and I took some introductory courses in the major and enjoyed it more than I ever have with software development. I've always had a slight issue with modern software development languages and frameworks but I figured I was in too deep already.

But after 7 or 8 months of no job I'm curious on what the opinion here is on getting a Masters degree in Data Science. I'm currently taking a Sports Data Analytics course on coursera through University of Michigan and am about 1/3 through it and enjoy it more than I ever enjoyed any computer science course.

Knowing all this, is it generally better to seek out a masters due to job market? Or is it better to save money and find data science projects that interest me and create a portfolio to hopefully find a job? Also, if I do a masters is there certain topics to look for on the courses for job security or is it more personal opinion?

Past data analyst wondering what else to do from here. I have 1 YoE having worked in fintech, using SQL and Tableau daily and having some exposure to AWS infrastructure. I have multiple years of internships in analyst work, and hold a Masters in Statistics from a T5 along with a bachelors in computer and cognitive science (AI focus, but didn't learn much about generative since it's a new topic and I'm not sure if i'm interested or qualified for generative or modern AI work atm)

I just want to know what to do from here. This market is abysmal, would it be helpful to try to get certifications? I'm thinking of working on AWS SAA and Power BI Data Analyst certifications, just literally anything to put me over the hundreds of candidates. I'm literally doing part time work just advising students to get into college. I literally want to know what to do, I want to be back on the market and doing data work but no one wants to hire me. I've failed two final stage interviews in the past three interviews, one because of poor presentation skills (which of course wasn't emphasized, instead they just gave a vague as fuck project) and one because I didn't have domain expertise. I really, really want to know what to do from here. It's been six months since a lay off and am I just really supposed to just keep chugging along? This market feels absolutely devastating.

Edit - I'm sitting at around 300+ apps at the moment, based in the Bay Area and applying to data science and analyst roles primarily. Occasionally any MLE, SWE, or data engineering work that feels like something I'm interested in. Is it worth branching out?

You should prepare more for interviews. Do case study challenges available online and read recommendations on how people tackle analytics interviews.

The problem you are having is it is a down market and you only have one year of experience, so you can only interview for junior and entry-level jobs. Most of those are extremely competitive or being put on hold.

I'd recommend looking for part-time contract work with smaller businesses or startups. Anything to get experience on your resume.

It's difficult, and the information is broad, to say the least. We've covered so many different topics it's hard to keep track of everything, but it's fascinating nonetheless.

I'm interested in audio applications. Growing up, I was into recording audio and slowly got into audio engineering (applying filters, effects, etc.) for music. Recently, I've got into a research position at my University that deals with analyzing acoustic emissions of fruits to extract phenotypic characteristic trends. Unfortunately, I can't get much more detailed than this due to NDA, but my role mainly focuses on preprocessing recorded data, integrating information from multiple sources, and conducting exploratory data analysis to identify meaningful trends.

The nice part about this job is that it doesn't rely much domain knowledge on fruits or their biology, as I'm working with a PhD student who has expertise in that field. My main focus is on extracting knowledge from the sound itself.

I'd like to go to graduate school after I finish my undergrad. My goal is to expand this sort of knowledge by studying audio classifiers and extracting value from sound.

Do you think this is a realistic career path in the data science/engineering domain, specifically focusing on audio applications?

Thanks for any insight!","22"

I am looking for information on transitioning from academia to industry and understanding what career options exist.

I recently completed a phd in the hard sciences but am quite burned out on academia and have no interest in continuing in the field my phd was in (there is only one other research group doing theoretical research in the same topic anyhow, and they are in a different country). I wish to pursue a career in industry but have found it difficult to answer recruiters' questions about my career plans, largely because I don't know what people outside of academia do. I have been expressing interest in data science and applied math.

I have a very strong background in math and programming (and this is evident on my resume), and have had short stints doing software engineering jobs. I have good intuition for statistics. I have no particular experience with machine learning / ""deep learning"" and have been steering clear of AI-related job openings (which cuts out like half of them these days....).

I have only the coarsest of understandings of the difference between data scientist / data analyst / data engineer / etc. I like doing pure research, especially applied math, but it seems such jobs are hard to come by outside of academia. The path of least resistance would be to go back to being a programmer (at least I know what a programmer does and I am good at it) but I'd rather something more fulfilling.

I am a CPA working in private industry (healthcare) accounting for 8 years, promoted each year until I burned out and left in November. I was working a lot with consultants on system implementations, integrations, and report writing projects, which is what got me interested in DS. I enrolled in DataCamp Data Engineer courses (75% complete) and plan on hopefully getting the certification in the next 2 months or so. This decision was a bit on a whim, but I've enjoyed learning. Now I feel like it's time to start figuring out what I can do with these new skills.

If I successfully complete the certification, with no other experience, is it reasonable to search for a $100k job?

How much value and opportunity does accounting/management background bring?

I prefer the problem-solving aspect of DS versus analytics. Is this relevant?

Are there absolute DOs and DON'Ts for finding a good gig in DS? (For example in Accounting, it's generally DO get your CPA; DON'T go to public unless you can work crazy hours during busy season.)

Other questions I have include- what's your role, and what does your day-to-day look like? Should I hire someone to job hunt for me (send out resumes, schedule interviews, etc)?

I suppose it's critical to mention that I'm not looking to trade one corporate grind for another.

I left a stable job of 5 years mainly because I needed a change and my company didnt have any promotions or transfers available to me. I felt stuck. It was a small company, and I was in a handful of quantitative analysts.

The job I took is at a major company, household name. The job listing sounded good. I stalked potential coworkers LinkedIn profiles. They all sounded solid.

My interviews went well. I did a tough case study in Python. Prepared good quality code with transferability in mind, expecting them to run it. Functionalized and optimized it. Parameterized it. Etc. Gave a presentation on the findings.

I got the offer, negotiated, took the job. I thought I was gonna have a lot of learning and catching up to do. But its been miserable.

I work as a data scientist for a public health focused group. Part of my role has been to bring new Machine Learning/AI technologies to the team. After a year in I am realizing that my management doesnt have many thoughts on what their outcome goals are. Historically, they are a reference/resource group that manages the big healthcare datasets acquisition/maintenance and supports the analytics of other groups that want to use these resources.

A lot of the projects that are completed are basic epi style studies (observational research, regressions for statistical inference).  I brought some ML projects to the group that technically meet the ML goal, but are still statistical inference focused. These were successful projects, but management seems underwhelmed by this approach. 

Managements goal seems to be that they want to create capacity for production ready ML models. But they dont actually have any problems creating a predictive model  would solve or the problems they have thought of actually dont make sense. For example they think it would be great to create a model for diagnostic prediction, without realizing that we have no scope to apply those models (anonymized patient data and no clinical setting to apply them) or they think that that a time series forecasting infectious disease trends, without realizing that since our data is scoped to anonymized clinical patient level that we actually are missing a lot of the data that would probably be useful to make a successful model (no GIS data and no hierarchical regional data). 

We did some NLP on clinical notes, but we are actually loosing the data set that has clinical notes, so that path is a dead end. I have been diving into time series analyses for like anomaly detection and I think I can see some benefits in that direction. I personally think that given the common types of questions that are presented to the group they would be nicely complimented by causal applications and more robust statistical models, but this direction wouldnt require any productionalization, so I think it will not meet the expectations of management.

Basically, management bought into the ML hype and started to build the infrastructure for ML/AI without stopping to think, does ML/AI solve the questions that make sense for us to ask.

So my questions to you all. 
1. Does anyone have thoughts on how to manage situations like these where the goal set by management is ML/AI without specific problems in mind to apply these tools. 
2. Does anyone have thoughts on ml/ai applications to the public health space they would recommend I look further into? Ideally, something that could be placed in production? I have been reviewing the literature on this, but I cant seem to find many good examples that meet the same scope of our group.

Which job to choose?

I'm about to graduate university soon and I currently have one job offer that I have accepted in a reputable tech MNC for a role that is kinda adjacent to what I'm studying but may not be super related (I studied Data Science, role is Pricing Analyst that is trying to incorporate more data driven solutions so they are looking for ppl with my background). Not sure if the role will be technical enough since I've experienced bait-and-switch before. I also don't know if I'll have a lot of technical guidance in the role since traditional Pricing Analysts usually have finance/business background. The company has good working culture and it is highly recognised internationally.

However, I'm having second thoughts because I'm currently having an internship with another reputable company (though smaller and less established internationally) where I may get a return offer. The thing is I enjoy the work here a lot because it is very related to what I'm studying (Data Science modelling role) and the work is very mentally stimulating to me. Culture of the company isn't the best (have to WFO) but I enjoy interacting with my colleagues enough to endure it. However, this company may also be more prone to layoffs than the first one.

Hypothetically, if I do have a return offer for the second company, which one should I choose if the salary and benefits are comparable for both companies? I know a bird in one hand is better than two in a bush but I can't stop thinking about this scenario as I really enjoy my work in the second company. But at the same time, I've built a great connection with the people in the first company so it'll make me very uncomfortable to renege on the signed offer.","35"

I recently got a work permit. I have 10 yr gap after my education.

While waiting for my work permit, which f****** took 9 yrs, I got certified in base and advanced SAS, did clinical SAS training. And been looking for job since a year.
 But all entry level requires at-least 5 yr of experience at least. How ridiculous is that. 
I got in touch with few consultancies as well, but they ghosted me after training completion, I even cleared mock interviews with them. But they ghosted me when it came to job placement. 
All internship positions require enrollment in college which is too expensive for me, the cheapest I could find was a Associate in Science degree(data science and analytics) program in local community college for around 10k.
My question is it worth it to take admission in college and apply for internships?

I'm in my late 20's with a Bachelor in Hummanities, currently working in Marketing for a tech company.

I like Marketing, but couldn't help but notice how data informs all major decissions in a company. I also work for a tech company, and I can see how data is such a huge industry, worth tapping into.

I've heard about data brokers recently, and I have been having thoughts about opening my own marketing/inteligence company someday, so I would need some sort of basic understanding of how to interpret data.
Furthermore, being able to analyze data and make informed decissions is a great trait for SEOs to have in general.

I also think it would match my  former Degree nicely, as it is in Antropology.

Now, for obvious reasons, deciding to go for a second Bachelors is not an easy decission, for multiple reasons:

1. Time Investment: It would take 3 years to complete and 2 years to consolidate practical experience.

2.  Age: There is a bit of an ego battle, since most of my course mates would be much younger than me, plus the fact that many will start questioning such a choice . To this, add the fact that most people my age are at different stages in their lives...so yes doing a degree now feels even more challenging, even if I know that shouldnt be the case.

3. Money: I live in Europe, so I would be able to follow a Bachelors for free, or for significantly cheaper than in the US.
Still, there are all the other living costs that would add up, plus the fact that I would only be able to work part-time.

4. Work Experience: I have been trying to research what I need, starting from several job descriptions for this role. Most, if not all of them asked for hands-on experience, so the entry seems really competitive, and not all Masters are being built equal.

Conversely, if I were to go for the certificate &amp; self-taught route, It wouldn't be as straight forward, but it would be faster, cheaper, and would go straight to the point.

P.S: I have also researched for Masters in the field, but for someone with a non-technical background such as myself, I found the contents to be less technical, and less hands on. I suppose that this would work on the idea of ""enhancing "" my formal education, and less about becoming a Data Analyst per se, hence the idea of doing a Bachelors instead of a Masters because realistically, that would be just a year longer.

I know this has been a HUGE post, but I appreciate any sort of imput that could help me get through this crossroads.

Thanks!","4"

You can do credentials for your own learning purpose, but they generally have little value on a resume.

I really don't understand the idea that the masters is less technical. You need to choose the right program, but there are plenty of masters programs that should be more technical than bachelors degrees.","4_1"

Greetings!

As the title said, i am looking to transition into DA/DS. To give a bit of background, I have a bachelors and msc in mechanical engineer from which I graduated 8 months ago. Unfortunately, I've realised a bit to late how wercked the job market for mech engineers is in my area, so I decided to invest the following 4 months to study (self learning basically) and train during my free time to transition into DS and hopefuly land a job as a junior at the end of it. I specially would like to gear towards business decissions and product management.

Now my question is: how would you recommend me to do so? I have 20 to 25h a week of free time to dedicate to this. I have quite a bit of experience coding already (I've worked a lot with python, know how to code websites with javascript and react). I also took some subjects about statistics and Design of Experiments in my bachelors (and actualy got pretty good grades in them).

Considering I am not ""starting from zero"" how whould you tackle this? What resources, online certifications books I should consume to make it? What coding lenguages should I learn? Any recommended udemy or coursera courses? Etc.. please I would like to know your thoughts and experience!!

Thanks a lot!!!","9"

I've been navigating my career in data science now for the past 5 years, starting with computational biology/genomics research, where I was deeply engaged with statistical modeling techniques, now to consulting, focusing on data risk &amp; privacy. Originally I was PhD track with a passion for genomics, but the reality of the financial situation I would be in changed my mind  thus moving to consulting for the money and experience in a variety of industries.

Although I've learned a lot about business and business technologies, my current position has moved me away from the hands-on statistical analysis and modeling, which I am passionate about, to more route business analytics. I'm looking to pivot back into a role that allows me to leverage my statistical modeling expertise more directly, similar to my time in research. Honestly, consulting has been rather disheartening, as I've just gotten stuck on projects that boil down to convoluted SQL scripts. I've tried expressing my desire to move to more complicated projects internally, as well as proposing extensions to projects that involve more complex statistics, but I've gotten shot down each time.

Could anyone share advice or strategies on how to find and land opportunities that align more closely with these interests? While I understand that most problems aren't going to require a complex statistical solution, I'm looking to find a role where my skills in statistics can be a cornerstone of my day-to-day responsibilities.

i've been looking for jobs since this past october, but it's really difficult to find ones that 1) have anything to do with actual data science and 2) are relevant to my more broad skillset. i know i might be asking for too much, but i'm truly hoping for a job that's interesting and not just rote sql or somesuch. i've been regularly looking on linkedin, indeed, my university's handshake, even some company websites like microsoft etc., but it's just really stressful/discouraging bc everything seems to either be a super senior position (i.e. 10+ years experience) or something not really relevant/pays pennies. i do have good previous work experience since i worked between undegrad and grad and have done a lot of different internships etc. over the years, as well as a math degree undergrad, but i am struggling so much with everything rn. i wanna find something that's not soul-sucking but that also actually puts my master's to good use. i'm especially interested in more r&amp;d and social science contexts for intersectional work / natural language processing / policy / etc.

i also have to work remotely bc i'm tied down geographically for the time being, so if anyone can pls rec good job boards/ways of finding data science jobs, especially remote ones, i'd be hugely appreciative. ty!","16"

I'm looking into transitioning into data science and have the opportunity to take a bootcamp through my employer. I know the opinion towards bootcamps generally skews negative, but hey it's hard to beat free, and I value a setting where I'm learning with peers and have an instructor in some capacity.

I wanted some help vetting the course curriculum. It's technically a FinTech bootcamp, but it has some overlap with data science topics, and while I'm interested in Finance, I want to make sure the skills I'm learning are more universally applicable than domain specific. Course content follows below:

**Financial Fundamentals**

* Time-Series Analysis
* Financial Ratios
* Financial Analysis
* Financial Modeling

**Machine Learning Applications in Finance**

* Algorithmic Trading
* Decision Trees and Random Forests

I am particularly uncertain about these interviews because 2 out of the 4 interviewers are high-level executives (director level and plus with 15+ years experience) of purely finance background and I am not sure how to prepare for them in the best way because of the difference in background.  
  
  
  
for example:  
  
I have no official background in finance besides a minor in Econ and reading/trading stocks on the side (if that counts) and the job descriptions do mention that they prefer someone with experiences in financial services/exchange operations. What can I highlight to make up for that? Some examples showing that I am a fast learner?  
  
What kind of questions should I ask at the end of the interviews? Since they are fairly high level execs, I probably should not ask stuff regarding day-to-day operations. So I am thinking about general questions on what they look for in a DS candidate, advice on learning about finance on the job coming from a non-finance background, etc.  
  
What kind of questions should I NOT ask at the end of the interviews?  
  
  
  
some other context that may be helpful:  
  
I passed the first round 30-min screen with the hiring manager, and he did mention that finance background won't be too crucial as you will learn as you go but I am still surprised that I passed without a finance background  
  
then I passed a technical screen on Hackerrank, questions on SQL, 1 LC Easy, and some Python multiple choices  
  
so these 4 interviews are the second round

- Learn data warehousing

At my company (big tech), contract worker funds typically come from a different budget than full time headcount, so it's easier to get access to those funds and we \*typically\* pay cheaper -- unless it's one of the big consultants, they are pricey. Anyway, I've noticed the industry outsourcing data science and data analysts more and more due to headcount not being as easy to source as it used to be.","2"

The biggest pro that I found in doimg contracting work, is that the interview process is short and fast. Instead of a grueling interview, you prove yourself during your time contracting and I have ALWAYS gotten an offer afterwards. 

Note - often times the contract rate is higher than the standard salary. Try to negotiate and you might be surprised though. This last contracting position I took, I was offered a permanent role at a slightly HIGHER salary which was pleasantly surprising.","3"

Moreover, VSCode offers the comprehensive features of an IDE, including syntax highlighting, debug mode, and interactive warnings, linters etc. enhancing your coding efficiency and experience. While preferences vary, for someone with experience, the advantages of using a full-fledged IDE with the appropriate extensions seem clear. Imho it offers a superior developer experience, combining the functionality of Jupyter with the powerful tools and features of an IDE, which, in my view, makes it a preferable choice over JupyterLab for those reasons.","6_1_1"

Price elasticities are usually *negative* (i.e., there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity). Sorry about that. They can be positive, but only in usual cases (either what are called Veblen goods or even more rarely Giffen goods). 

If e=-1 (called ""unit elastic""), then a +5% change in price, then there is a -5% decrease in demand. 

If e=0 (called ""perfectly inelastic""), then a change in price has no change in quantity demanded. Examples of highly inelastic goods is gas, medications, airline tickets, etc. Although in practice nothing is actually perfectly inelastic.

Usually the more inelastic a good is, the more economically justified it is to regulate the price. For example, in most places electricity and fuels used to heat homes are subject to some sort of government oversight to protect consumers (it's also justifiable to regulate them because they're also what are called ""natural monopolies"").","7_1_1"

The ordering does matter. To be transparent, I don't have a lot of context myself (though I'm actively trying to get more). The timestamps represent individuals who do certain operations, and the goal is trying to measure whether some activities are done correctly (or perhaps I should use 'consistently'). For that I need to identify what group of timestamps represents a set of meaningful actions. Unfortunately I can't get the context for that, all I have is the data and the internal patterns to help me identify those. For this reason, I have to group consecutive groups together (like 1 &amp; 2) but I can't group 1 &amp; 4 together without including 3 &amp; 4.  
  
Overall, I'm struggling to say whether in the above example this represents 4 actions, 2 actions, or a single action. In theory it could be any one of those, in practice, there's only one correct grouping. In principle, identifying the patterns is key to determining the right level to look at this, but at least so far I've done it in a fairly unsophisticated way.","4_1"

1. Is it even possible at this point to make the switch? 

I have no experience in the area of computer or data science. My most relevant experience is taking an AP Statistics class my senior year of high school (I did alright, got a 3 on the AP exam). My only other experience with data is being an avid baseball fan and looking at stats often for that. 

2. What does data science entail?

I have a friend that is majoring in data science at Northeastern University, he says it involves math and coding from our limited conversations about it. I have no experience with coding. My dream is to work in the baseball field in some capacity.

3. What should I do to prepare?

Since I have about a year before I would transfer to a school for data science, what should I do in the meantime to prepare? Should I do a coding boot camp over the summer. Try to take some summer courses at my school in computer science if they offer them? Take a coding class online? Any recommendations help!

4. What schools are good for data science? Preferably in New York, but willing to leave. 

I dont really have an exact budget, but Id prefer an affordable option if possible so Im not in student loan debt forever. I also prefer to go to in person classes rather than online. I am having a hard time finding a bachelors program in just data science in New York or surrounding states. Most schools I look at only offer Masters programs in data science. Should I look at going for just computer science? Is that harder?


TL;DR- Im looking to do data science with no prior experience. Is it possible? Any reccomendations? 

Anything helps!","4"

Data Science is at the intersection of computer science and applied statistics, with a touch of economics amd general business. If you like programming and statistical modeling, then data science may be for you.


You mentioned an interest in sabermetrics. I'd recommend a book called Analyzing Baseball Data with R. You'll eventually want to learn Python, but it's a really good book for baseball analysis that happens to be geared for R. I'd work through the exercises and then take a run at some projects on your own. I would not do a coding boot camp. It's a relatively expensive way of (possibly) acquiring skills you can get via less expensive means. I'd recommend a Fangraphs membership (so you can easily download baseball data) and a ChatGpt Pro account. If you need something structured, then something like Data Camp will likely be far cheaper than a boot camp and very possibly better instruction.","4_2"

Hey everyone, I'm new to this subreddit. I'm from Brazil, 33 years old, and I began my career transition at 27 when I started my undergraduate degree in Computer Science. I also have an undergraduate degree in Law and an MBA, but I've always been passionate about technology, which led me to pursue CS. During my studies, I developed a keen interest in the Machine Learning field and began studying Data Science.

As part of my undergraduate experience, I engaged in a research project focused on estimating fruit productivity in orchards using Computer Vision. This project primarily utilized OpenCV and Yolo, so there wasn't a significant Machine Learning implementation. Additionally, I worked on a simulation project using Unity for building evacuation, which, while not directly related to Data Science, provided valuable experience.

For my final undergraduate project (a requirement for certification), I developed a complete data pipeline for my family's company, targeting the sales team. This involved interviewing staff, mining data from the database, establishing a data warehouse structure on SQL Server, creating an ETL with SSIS, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Python, and designing a dashboard with Power BI. These tasks primarily involved Data Analysis (DA) and Data Engineering (DE).

Since 2022, for about a year and a half, I've been working as a data science consultant for a major bank in Brazil, focusing mainly on experimentation.

I'm currently seeking international job opportunities, but I believe there's much more for me to learn. I study every day to address my knowledge gaps. However, during my last interview, I struggled with a live coding task because I'm accustomed to using Pandas in Python, and the task required using only dictionaries and Python functions. Additionally, the task didn't use a Python interpreter, so to verify if something would work, I had to consult the recruiter.

I'm seeking advice on how to prepare for an international job, how to assess if I'm at the right level, and what I should study next. Can someone help me?","9"

From the company's perspective, it's completely understood that you are still an unfinished product and you will need a lot of guidance and training - that's totally okay!

Since you have a Bio Master's Degree, I'd try to lean towards Biostatistics--that's a natural pivot. There should be a decent number of Life Sciences positions looking for Statisticians of some capacity. But even if you want to move towards Tech or non-Bio, you just have to heavily market yourself as a ""Statistician"".  

In terms of how to leverage yourself, this is what I can think of:

* **Make your resume as Statistics-heavy as possible!**
  * Discuss your projects that use Statistical analysis/modeling, during which you should emphasize your familiarity with R and Python. It seems like you're going to have to let your Stats-heavy projects do the most lifting on your resume.
  * Add in SQL experience if you can--even if you don't use it, you can ""gain SQL experience"" if you have data from your projects, by loading it yourself into a SQL database and familiarizing with how to write SQL queries. You don't need to be a pro-fessional at SQL, just pro-ficient enough to manipulate and obtain data at a reasonable level for interviews. 

* **Have you graduated yet?** 
  * If not, does your program offer a Stats/Biostats sub-track you can pivot towards more? 
  * If you already graduated, can you reasonably add a sub-bullet point to your resume saying something like ""Emphasis: Statistics/Biostatistics"" (buzzwords for resume ATS, and gives you benefit of the doubt to recruiters about your Statistics background).
      * And technically you aren't claiming that the program had a specific Stats/Biostats track that you followed, you're just emphasizing that you focused on Stats/Biostats. 
      * If you're not comfortable saying that, maybe have a ""Relevant Courses"" sub-bullet under education that focuses on all of the Stats courses/projects/etc. you took. 

* **I don't think a certification will help a ton, especially in a very bloated market.** 
  * It might not hurt, but you're investing time (and maybe money...) into something that I've heard recruiters say they give no emphasis towards anymore, due to the number of people who claim to be DS with a Certificate nowadays.

* **If you don't mind, expand your horizons to include DA positions as well as DS positions.** 
  * The DA -&gt; DS track is still common enough, and having some DA experience can help recruiters in the future look at your background and see a good fit for the DS position when perhaps right now, they might be off-put by the ""no DS/Stats/CS/etc. background"".","21_2"

slightly longer answer: For this project I anticipated refactoring it in short bursts over a long time period. In my experience this is far easier with Haskell vs anything else because the type system will remind you of most of the constraints you probably would have forgotten by the time you refactor (and I suppose this extends to other developers as well). Furthermore, haskell has great parsing libraries (aeson et al) which in this case is non-trivial since most of the job is downloading and processing JSON. Also the build tools for haskell are far easier to use in a reproducible manner (compared to conda for instance) which further enables all the above points.

As far as a web interface specifically, haskell has [one](https://www.yesodweb.com/) (at least) which I have yet to use because TBH every time I make an app like this (in any language) I try to justify making a web interface and fail because the CLI is good enough for what I need ;)

I will admit python (or go? I've never used it) probably has better web libraries, specifically for making wizzy data-sciency graphs; however, graphs and such were never part of the original scope anyways.","1_1"

The main problem you will run into is only having observational data without any randomized or controlled data.

So you can build a model to predict who will be most likely to adopt chat in the near future. But that's not really what you care about.

What you actually care about is answering the question:

Who will have the biggest increase in probability to migrate to chat if we were to take action with some intervention (such as reaching out to the customer, etc.)

The difference is very important. For example, you might have two customers. One customer A has a 2% chance of migrating to chat and another customer B has a 98% chance of migrating to chat soon.

But those numbers are just the baseline observational predictions if you did nothing and don't intervene. Let's say you run another model that says if you were to reach out to customer and intervene, then customer A has a 42% chance of migrating and customer B would have a 99% chance of migrating.

So we can see in that case, by intervening on customer A we can increase their chances of migrating by 40%! But if we intervene on customer B, it only increases their chances by 1%. So we should just target customer A since they will be the highest ROI customers to intervene on.

One last thing, but ideally you should be running some RCT or A/B tests where you randomly intervene and contact customers. Otherwise your model won't be able to learn the causal relationship between your intervention and your outcome.","1"

To give some idea of scale, I have a personnel budget of around $1M and contractors are somewhere around $500k. FWIW, if I had an extra $150k or so, I'd probably hire a full-time project manager to help better manage contractors and external partners.  

External parties can have expertise that can be deeper and wider than a small internal team. However, they often lack the full context and so you need regular staff with technical skills to provide regular feedback to keep the projects on track. 

My observation is that organizations tend to oscillate between all external or all internal, when really a convex solution is optimal. If you don't have sufficient in-house expertise, you can't effectively manage contractors. But you need to reach a certain level of scale for 100% in-house to be viable, much less efficient. For us, 2/3rds on regular employees and 1/3rd on contractors seems to work well, although like I said I'd like to tweak it to 70/30 by adding a full-time project manager.","2"

In an in-house team scenario, the business side of the project would actually have to spend time crafting the requirements and working collaboratively on the process redesign with the Data Science team - this would be foundational work actually. In case of outsourcing, the external firm would come up with flashy stuff and setting high expectations at the beginning - since they dedicatedly work on certain problems, they would have templates to work with. This makes work easy for the business people as they have to think less or spend less time on the project. Then, the external team asks support with data, master data mapping, integration with existing related systems etc. Once the project goes live, $$$$$ has already been spent and there are people in the company who are invested in making the project look good! There's an unsaid understanding that the lack of impact, if any, should not be talked about - because then, questions will come from the top leadership!

But sometimes there are external companies with some data or technology we can't get our hands on or develop easily.

I think just buying everything would fragment the application landscape too much. You end up with a lot of monolith, end-to-end systems that might have overlapping functionality.

If you are a very small company or for some reason you don't need to maintain or build models (a software you buy for lightweight analytics is enough), then it's not worth it: you can hire someone for such occasional task.

But if you need such data processes, then hiring someone internally will allow you as a company to instruct them more deeply about the flow of information, stakeholders and objectives. This way, these people would gradually start to align with the company mission.

External people are aligned for the time the project takes. When it's done, they leave you with bugs which will be hard to track back. Moreover, many organizations don't want their data to be seen by outsiders, so privacy and security play a bit role as well.","8"

If you averaged the covariates and the responses each day you have lost a lot of the power to detect such a difference under many conditions.","1_1_1_1_1"

I did math undergrad and two years of a PhD before switching to materials science engineering. I took some CS and ML oriented courses throughout. My first job out of grad school was in operations research at a large chemical and specialty materials company.

Most operations research problems in practice require you to be good at modeling, but you are rarely doing anything which is mathematically complex. There was a significant object oriented programming requirement to manage creating all the supply chain and manufacturing components which went into the optimization problems.

Id say CS with a program that specifically hits on data science, and if you really want to do OR specifically, try to take a class or two in the industrial engineering department related to optimization or simulation. But two years of experience just doing those problems would be way more beneficial than the school if you can self direct your study.","1"

This doesn't look like a traditonal ""missing values"" issue. This is more of a ""unavailability of labelled data"" issue.

I'd suggest you manually label some of these samples using available subject matter expertise and proceed from there.","4"

But the data that you need to focus on all belong to the pool of ""test stopped"", right ? So my point was that this is not a missing values problem. ""Missing"" in your case seems to imply ""potentially defective"".

Now, coming back to labelling the data - 
manually labelling is always an option. It's just a question of how to leverage the available human efforts efficiently. 
The test seems to be stopping because of an anomaly. If you have 100k features, perhaps you can setup a rule to identify the relatively smaller subset of relevant features that deviated from the mean/median and caused the test to stop. Then get expert(s) to only observe these subset values to identify if it was a false negatives or a true negative for a few samples and then try to build a model with this labelled data as needed.

Note - here I'm assuming that the test stopped because some observed value was indeed truly anomalous (deviating from the mean/median etc) consistently for the problem defined. If your problem is actually simpler and observed values for tests that stopped are not truly anomalous, then simple rules like the following might just work
""For each feature do,
         If mean - 3*std_dev &lt; observed value &lt;
                    mean +3*std_dev, then 
                  Return `true negative`

Return `false negative` ""

I can't overstate how oversaturated the market is right now with people trying to break into the field. Here are some numbers:

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (I know you're in Europe, but US data is what I've got easy access to), there were ~169k data scientists employed in the US in 2022 with expected ~18k/yr job openings (new jobs plus vacancies). I'd wager that probably only about a third of those are entry-level openings. Note: these numbers are for data scientists and do not include data analysts.

To put that in perspective, just in the US there are about 437k graduates with Bachelors in STEM, 147k with Masters in STEM, and 29k with PhD in STEM field. That's just fresh graduates. Now not all of them are trying to get into data science, but many are. And that doesn't include everyone from other majors who do Google's certificate or whatever and think that makes them competitive with CS and Stats majors. And it also doesn't include people with years of experience in data related areas. Nor does it include all of the international applicants from programs that are generally more rigorous than the typical US university (and certainly more rigorous K12). So for ~6k job openings for entry-level in the US, there are easily many, many times that in terms of applicants.

So we are at a moment of extreme disequilibrium with the data science labor market where number of applicants is many times greater than openings. If it seems like employers are unrealistic in expectations in terms of education and years of experience, believe me we're not. Many candidates with those sorts of qualifications are available. I'm not currently hiring, but if I posted a job for an entry-level data analyst position tomorrow, I could practically guarantee that I'd get a half dozen applications from people with credentials that approach my own (graduate degrees, 15+ years of experience in data/research and another 6 years of full-time experience not data-related). I say that based on the strength of the applicant pools for data analysts of other departments who have hired more recently.

Finally, there also may be a generational element to this: Zoomers (i.e., anyone born after 2000) have a bad reputation when it comes to work ethic. I don't agree with that assessment (i.e., the one Zoomer on my team is excellent), but that bias is definitely present among the Gen Xers and older Millennials who are hiring managers for entry-level positions. All other things being equal, if given a choice between a &lt;25 year-old and an older applicant, many hiring managers will go with the older applicant and not just because they likely have more years of full-time experience. Even if annual job openings suddenly doubled, there would still be excess supply and not enough seats for everyone when the music stops. And AI allows employers to get more productivity over existing workers rather than hire more entry-level. 

I'm really not trying to cause you anxiety, discourage you, or otherwise make you feel bad this morning. But it's a really tough labor market and I'm not sure it's going to get any better, at least not in the short-term. The best thing you can do is network, network, network. Because a robust professional network helps a lot when you're looking for a job. Meanwhile, develop a backup plan because you might not be successful at breaking into this field given the number of applicants to number of entry-level job openings. It's super competitive and, because of that market dynamic, starting salaries have stagnated if not receded from where they were a few years ago in real terms.","1"

*-I say relatively because with the tech layoffs of late 2023 and early 2024, there are a lot of highly qualified data analysts and scientists looking for work, many of whom have at least 3 years of full-time work experience. But the overproduction is really with entry-level. 

Also, I suspect there's possibly also a generational bias, at least with some hiring managers, against Gen Z (i.e., most of the people fresh out of undergrad and Masters programs). All other things being equal, I think many employers would rather hire someone over 30 than someone 25 or younger because of perceived differences in work ethic.

I also made notes to remember things. I also studied the available distance metrics that you can switch out in some algorithms. Also, every clustering algorithm working in a Euclidean or similar metric space expects your data to be normalized.

scikit-learn has the most famous basic algorithms, so its good to know them.

From my experience: Bayesian Gaussian mixture models are good and HDBSCAN. HDBSCAN also is a package on its own that has more knobs to turn and generates additional output.

There are some fundamental things you have to ask yourself about a given clustering algorithm:

* does it make assumptions on the shape of clusters?
* do clusters have to be of comparable extent, number of points and density?
* how well can it deal with the curse of dimensionality? This heavily depends on the metric that you are using, But none of them really do well, so dimensionality reduction without massively destroying cluster structure is a good idea, for example UMAP (Not included in scikit-learn). You can for example, use cross validated reconstruction error to find the optimal reduced dimensionality, or look at the clustering quality as a parameter of the target dimensionality.
* can it generate a probabilistic output?
* does it have an outlier bucket? (This can be very important)
* does it find the number of clusters itself or do I need to use some quality of clustering metric and optimize the number of clusters as a hyperparameter? (Unsupervised clustering quality metrics are included in scikit-learn, you should look at them also).
* can it classify new points?
* how does it deal with hierarchical clusters?

There is a really nice review from 2023. Its called:

An overview of clustering methods with guidelines for application in mental health research

Its really mostly about just clustering and very little about application in mental health research.

  
Also: I highly recommend the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow. It has about 60 pages on clustering and dimensionality reduction. All very simple explain with lots of pictures.

I would run first a dimensionality reduction algorithm, like UMAP, then a clustering algorithm like HDBSCAN, vary the parameters of UMAP and see how it impacts cluster quality and number of clusters, so the idea is to find the optimal dimensionality but also tune the other parameters a bit (they are more robust, but still)

Now you can probe where new points would fall. UMAP I think lets you map new or shifted points and also HDBSCAN. HDBSCAN also can give you class probabilities.

Note: To see if you even have clusters, I would try a bunch of simple dimensionality reduction techniques on the data (PCA) or maybe on some subspace of the data (reduced dimensionality). In addition there are metrics like the Hopkins statistic that assess how chunky your data is, and can give you a clue (supposedly) if you even have clusters.

If you dont have clusters, given that you seem to be talking about customer behavior, Factor Analysis might be worth a try (meaning you only do this particular dimensionality reduction and thats it. Without clustering afterwards). Then you get every customer projected down to a hopefully meaningful set of dimensions. Make sure you use statsmodels and not scikit-learn as it has better oblique rotations available.","4"

It's also important to comment that hype-words (Kubernetes; which data scientists know it well enough to do something useful and stable? It's not a good use for your time.) used by HRs are bullshit we engineers (you kind of are now) need to take with criticism.

However, I was a SWE for a few years, I would strongly suggest that if you need an API, analytics, etc., you don't implement it by yourself. I once moved all of the infra to a cloud provider using only services like elastic Beanstalk and analytics services that work with logs in buckets. The gain is huge since you get monitoring almost for free and eventually, the setup becomes much less fragile. You are facing a decision with at least three options: 1. you do implement monitoring for the probably messy setup you already have (probably not realistic to make monitoring actionable in this case, you will re-invent the wheel). 2. if it's cheap and easy, you move to services instead of this custom (perhaps) mess. 3. new services will use robust tools and not custom, fragile solutions. Ideally, you do not want to code infra. Code is bad, code is bugs.

I am not really sure what automated cleaning means, but I assume you have scripts that transform the data. For that, you should learn about data pipelines. Essentially, what you do, is extract the data, transform it, and send it to the relevant service/other pipeline. Ideally, you want the process divided into multiple steps with assertions, so you can see where failure occurs. I used a CI/CD tool for that, but there are probably better solutions (again, cloud services).

I definitely think that you should provide more specifics, i.e., how many services do we talk about? If it's \~5 you can possibly migrate to better deployment tools, if 100, not so much... What are the costs? Does it use many resources? It's all about tradeoffs.","1"

This should trigger my PySpark script to automatically clean the data and store it in our database, eliminating the need for manual CSV handling, script execution, and data storage on my part.

As of now, I've deployed six services, making it relatively simple for me to migrate everything while the setup is still fresh in my mind. Regarding costs, I'm currently uncertain. I've been leveraging open-source libraries, which meet our needs without any expense but require a more hands-on approach. It's unclear how much my company is willing to invest in such services, but I assume the budget is limited. Our requirements don't call for extensive functionality; we need modest dashboards integrated into web applications for each client. The projects are small-scale, with each web application supporting no more than 50 users.

In terms of resources, our web applications consume minimal amounts. They comprise straightforward front-end and back-end components. On the hardware side, we only require storage for our databases since our user base does not significantly strain RAM or CPU resources.

Given these considerations, could you recommend any services that cover the entire data stack? I'm not well-versed in comprehensive service options and, given our small-scale operations, we don't need the extensive solutions that larger companies might require.

Also, I code all the dashboards and web-applications because I like to code! I have to admit, migrating everything to services makes me feel I took a Msc. for nothing...","1_1"

Suppose you sample two datasets of size N that you evaluate your model on. It makes sense that the AUCROC computed on both datasets may differ due to the random sampling and finite datasets.

So the question is, how large is the discrepancy? If it's relatively small then I wouldn't consider it very strange.

If it's a large difference, that seems more fishy (unless the datasets are small or prone to distribution shifts).","1"

I can see how distribution shifts might change the performance, but that should decrease the performance of the model fitted to the previous distribution, unless something exceptional happens, right?

The internal set is balanced???? Well that answers all your questions right there lol.

The test set should NEVER be upsampled or downsampled in any way.

The fact that they are evaluating on an artificially balanced test set tells me that all of the results are entirely meaningless and useless in my opinion.

That is just a large and glaring error that I wouldn't trust much of anything else in the study.

EDIT: One last addition, but you mention there are thousands of rows with a 95/5 balance. That would imply that there are potentially less than a hundred positive samples.

Don't forget that AUCROC is essentially the probability of properly ranking one randomly selected positive sample and one randomly selected negative sample.

So if your dataset has less than 100 positive samples, you will see higher variance in your estimate intuitively. 

But even with that being said, the fact that authors evaluated on an artificially balanced test set tells me that there are likely a lot more glaring errors and issues in the entire paper to render it useless.","1_1_1"

Alternative possibilities include:

1. Data Splitting: The validation dataset might be more representative of the overall population than the training dataset. If the validation data happens to have clearer patterns or less noise, the model could perform better on it.

2. Model Overfitting: It's possible that the model is overfitting to the training data, capturing noise or specific patterns that are not generalizable. This can lead to lower performance on unseen data, such as the validation set. Regularization techniques like dropout, weight decay, or early stopping could help mitigate overfitting.

3. Imbalanced Classes: Class imbalances between the training and validation datasets could affect AUROC scores. If the validation set has a more balanced distribution of classes, the AUROC might appear higher compared to the training set.

4. Data Leakage: Leakage of information from the validation set into the training process can inflate performance metrics on the validation set. Ensure that data preprocessing steps, such as normalization or feature scaling, are performed separately for the training and validation datasets to prevent leakage.","3"

A lower cutoff BMI of 25 kg/m2 (overweight) in White adults, translated to a BMI of 23.4 kg/m2 for Black, 22.2 kg/m2 for Chinese, 22.1 kg/m2 for Arab, and a much lower BMI of 19.2 kg/m2 for South Asian adults is noted.

The common advice for ""stakeholder management"" is various ways of saying ""No"" and/or advice about project management. However I feel that this is just a small part of what stakeholder management actually is. In my experience doing stakeholder management WELL is actually more about the ART of understanding the politics of your own position in relation to the politics of the company/organization as a whole. Once you understand that you can develop the relationships you need in order to effectively manage your workload (by saying No/de-prioritization or ignoring requests). The reason I call it an art is because there's no one-size-fits-all way of doing this. It's entirely context-dependent and is about understanding who is asking for something, what level of power they hold, and who you need to be on your side (""cover you"") if and when you have to say No. 

For more junior people, the key relationships are probably their own manager and (probably more effectively) their manager's manager. For more senior people, it usually becomes more about creating relationships with the most senior cross-functional people you can. This is all has to be done ahead of time. In other words: Saying No to people will almost for sure piss them off to some extent and the goal here is to PREEMPT THEM by using the hierarchy of the organization to your own leverage. Like the best circumstance is when people are pissed off at you but they barely even bother to pursue it because they know it's already a lost situation for them. 

Of course: as a junior person this is much more challenging when your own leaders don't do this themselves. I've found as a manager it's vital for me to do all of this to protect peoples' time. There are also certainly circumstances where the culture of the company/org is to just grind everyone to dust and it's very hard to get around that but I'd argue those are the situations where you get the experience and money you need from the role and then get out of there ASAP (which it sounds like basically what happened to the woman who made the Youtube video).","1_4_1_1"

 That said, when there's a conflict between employee and employer, 95% of the time I'm taking the employee's side. So they're going to have to present a pretty damning case against her to sway me all the way over to their side.","1_8_1_1_1_1_1"

I'm a SWE, not a data scientist, but my answer for a case like this is quite simple.

Me: ""I'm struggling to meet the demands here. My understanding is that this is a very important and high priority initiative, is that right?""

Stakeholder: ""Yes, it's very high priority and urgent.""

Me: ""So why am I the only person who's working on it? Can we get more resources?""

Then the stakeholder is forced to either backtrack and admit that the urgency and priority isn't as high as they're making it out to be, or else is forced up the chain of command to provide additional resources.

If this seems confrontational, _it is_. If you work at a place where you feel afraid to have a direct conversation like this, you need to get out regardless.","2"

IMO the best play in these situations is not to bristle, but try and reflect the stakeholder's excitement and commitment to success on the project, work hard (but not so hard you burn yourself out), but be realistic about the fact that you're just one person and that's going to make it possibly slower than they'd hope.

Believe me, I've been anxiously aware of that. I just turned 30 this week and my entire 20s I knew I could get by due to my youth but I can't maintain the same throughput and intensity in my 30s. I've built and bootstrapped roughly 6-8 registered companies in my 20s spanning a few industries. I mainly funded it through another business I launched.

I've mainly been founding startups and some of the past deals have been in the lower double digit million amounts, covid unfortunately cost me that deal and it was almost cleared. Startup expenditures and other factors come in to play as well. Currently I have a very big upside in telecommunications, the issue is this part of the industry has a horrible software standard (oss) and so I'm kinda forced to build the erp software while doing mostly everything else. I can delegate but they all feel like interns until we scale and I can hire better talent. Talent is hard to find.

I've taken a backseat to dating, social, holidays and vacations. Currently I'm still pushing but I'm feeling severely fatigued, energy levels bottomed out. The light at the end of the tunnel is very high amounts of appreciation monetarily, my monthly payout scales with the number of customers, at a bottom 10% that would still result in me having roughly 40-100k a month and when I get there most things will be automated per my work. However, until we get there, the work on my plate feels disgusting. 

You sound incredibly successful, I think after I'm done automating everything, my weekly hours will drop to 20 hopefully and I can regain some of my own time once more. My friends and family are of course worried about my workload and work habits as well. Ultimately I think I have another 1-2 years max in me at this pace before I just can't anymore. I have pivots in place should that happen, but optimistically the next 3-5 months will be the most cruicial.

Highly productive and high intellect people seem to occupy the same people who don't like saying no, people please and overanalyse and think maybe they are performing badly and thats why it takes 14 hours every 7 hour day (they aren't performing badly).

Task estimation has been repeatedly studied as a phenomenon.

Humans consistently underestimate how long tasks take. They consistently underestimate it even when *reminded that humans underestimate how long tasks take and have previous underestimates pointed out to them*.

So the simple answer is just pad it out, and then pad it out some more. You should feel a little embarrassed at how much you've padded it out. That's about the right spot. And start tracking your work and how long things actually take.

The complex answer is that when given a ""generous"" deadline humans start slowing down, mucking about in details, etc etc. That's why it's really important to combine generous deadlines with more strict, goal orientated styles of project management.","5_2_2"

My experience on those teams was at mid-growth-stage startups in zero-interest era. IMO, a lot of those DS were not ever necessary, and yeah, a lot have gotten laid off in the past years, but the ones with a little more vision left on their own before that.

I'm not on data teams anymore but the DS team I work with now is small but managed well. They have a lot of backlog but the top is prioritized according to what needs to get done. A lot of us who are still working in tech rn are probably working a little harder, but still, managers should manage expectations / priorities / politics in a way to not have people working 10-12 hours for months. She also mentions she has a very strong identity tied to her job and she's young and doesn't know better -- that probably made this worse.

If you think of the current macroenvironment coupled with the fact that Spotify has generally not been profitable, even in zero interest times, then. yeah. maybe not the best place.

This was at a start up with a lot of problems, but it just killed me that we were struggling to do some very basic product things, like consistently delivering a valuable product, and here was a team burning millions per year without any idea how what they were doing was going to contribute.  


Prioritization for these projects is just so hard to get right.

I think a lot of companies are figuring out they have to strategize their spend better in the current environment, some doing better than others. I'd take the interview experience as a chance to get to see who your manager would be, what they're working on, what tech they're using, why they need you. There are also subtle ways to ask about culture. IMO that stuff is almost as important, or more important, than the actual company name, unless you're at a FAANG / good resume name. 

Just so you know, tech and DS allows for a lot of jumping, so for your first role, I wouldn't get too hung up. Hopefully you land something good, otherwise jump ship when you can line something else up. 

When it comes to spotify specifically, I haven't heard a ton about their culture, but as someone who's worked in music, I'll say the industry itself is tough. There's a lot of money being paid out to people, and yet it feels like no one is making substantial money, except I guess maybe the record labels. More streaming (aka growth) = more royalties to be paid, and more growth for Spotify = more money for the labels to ask for a larger portion of. That's probably why Spotify is doing the big podcast bet, and also audiobooks now. Just my two cents on that end. Don't want to discourage you, but it's just the reality of music :/ (edit: i will add, there are other DS jobs in music, they might net less money and/or less prestige. otherwise, the other major streamers could also be options since many have other income).","13_2_1"

I was making 175k a year as a Senior Scrum Master for 2 teams.  1 team of 5 developers + a data scientist (I come from analytics and metrics development myself).  My 2nd team was part of a marketing team.

Anyway, I was working 10 hours a day, sleep was getting worse, and my manager wasn't supportive.  My hobbies were slowly fading away and I was just working + trying to sleep + cooking for my wife and I.

My manager was pretty much AFK and he didn't even know what projects we were working on unless I told him - so no support at all.

Anyway, I quit back in sept.  got a new job now in an unrelated field, but it's giving me time to pursue a new degree!  And I like my new job, manager, team, etc.  And I like where my life is going.   Oh yeah and it's a 100k pay cut.  But whatever, wife and I are fine financially.  Avg salary for the career I'm pursuing is 200k so fingers crossed that a few years from now I'll be better off than I was before.

Two stand-ups each day.  Two grooming sessions each week for 2 teams (4 total sessions).  2 demos every 2 weeks.  2 retros every 2 weeks.  2 refinements with sprint kick-off every 2 weeks.

I was also Scrum of Scrum for a large project (moving data from a data center - we had an entire facility just for data - to the cloud (AWS).  These meetings were 1 hour every week.  14 SMs giving updates.

Scrum stuff was in the morning because half the team was in India.  Other half in US.  Morning worked best.  Between both teams, 1 hour each day for stand-ups.  2 hours some days if it was refinement, retro, or demo.

Whenever there's a human behaviour that doesn't make rational sense, then the reason likely is not a rational one.

Then you can look at the emotional and systemic reasons:

* have to support a family and work in an environment where you can get fired because someone got offended by the wrong joke?Â 
* no one ever taught you how to say ""no"" in a constructive way or how to set boundaries? That creates uncertainty. Rational behaviour in humans and uncertainty aren't the best mix.Â 
* or you actually know how to say ""no"" but you've had the wrong people in your life who get super offended by a reasonable request because it inconveniences them momentarily? Your behaviour kinda adapts because no matter how strong you are as an individual, you're not in a vacuum and subject to the community of people around you.

Also, it's a question of perception. If everyone does overtime and you don't see anyone speak up against it, then in your perception, everyone does it and for all intents and purposes this is what ""normal"" is.

* bargaining (e.g ""I can give you A and B now but C will have to wait as it's high effort low reward"", ""What is the minumum you need to enabled?"")

If that's all done and the workload is still too high for an extended period (work sometimes comes in waves) then I'd bring it up with the manager as more help is required in a constant level.

1) Weird video, especially the beginning and when she laughed while giving her resignation.

2) Lead data scientist, sole data scientist, highest priority project.. thats a senior position or higher, not L2. She should have had a lead on the project with her, or rapid advancement commensurate with those responsibilities. Thats an organizational failure. Healthy grain of salt, its likely she means a highest priority project local to her department, not at Spotify.

3) Seeking a new job was the right choice, though I would not have quit.  I think it would have been better to scale back her hours to ~6 / day while job hunting. Ride the paychecks while interviewing, until she found a new role or was fired.","60"

The problem is that, if this is something that changed while you were already employed (i.e., new boss/new project that starts demanding &gt;8 hours a day), then any attempt to protect your personal time could get you fired, PIPed, laid off, etc. 

I think it's one thing when a group *accidentally* overloads a person - i.e., that person doesn't know how to say no, and they end up taking on more that they can handle. But when a team is just ok with giving people more work than they can do in a 40 hour week, odds are that if you go to them and say ""no"", they're going to say ""ok, I'll find someone who will"".

If you find yourself in a job that is overworking you like that, really you just need to start looking for another job asap. If you have the runway and a good enough job market, it may even be worth quitting the job and then looking for a new job full time. But really the only real solution is finding a new job.","65"

That's why my next two last sentence was this - because you're right, some jobs just don't really allow you the time to prepare for, interview for, etc. another job. And if that's the case then what you really need to do is build yourself a runway however you can and then quit. Which is easier said than done. 

Now, mind you - one thing to note is that most large companies will never fire you on the spot. If you start slowing down and not getting ""enough"" done, they will put you on a PIP, and that can take like 3 months to really get done especially if you don't outright stop working but just quiet quit a bit. But even in those instances, you need to be ready to somewhat field the pressure of a boss that is going to be breathing down your neck, furious about not having you working yourself to death.","65_1_1"

Based on n=1837, so it has splits by experience, industry, education, region, etc. VP level I guess doesn't have enough sample size. It basically stops at ~director.

Every source like this or levels.fyi will have some bias though, compared with the overall market. Levels is biased heavily to tech companies and places with higher pay, the above seems biased away from tech companies, and both are biased against companies with low budget for roles.","16_1"

I do agree with OP that getting above manager is hard, and getting to VP is very very hard. Not that many of those jobs out there and the competition is fierce.

You can model units sold by taking a log transformation of quantity sold, product price. Taking log(Q)=a + b*log(P). For this equation the parameter b has an actual meaning which is price elasticity of demand. taking log of those two quantities also has the benefit as it scales the values and you minimise the effects where some products sell ridiculous amounts of quantities whereas some other products sell less (e.g. expensive products).

This equation can be expanded further where you add other variables that explain the sell-ability of your products (seasonality, holidays, promotions, website traffic) and model it as linear equation.

You can even introduce non-linearity by multiplying terms together but this requires a careful consideration if you want to be able to explain.

Let's simplify a bit because I don't want to get into messy math (I suck at math), just to demonstrate the point:

log(Q)=a+log(P)-&gt;a=log(Q)-log(P)-&gt;a=log(Q/P)

Q/P seems about right in this regard but I will leave it to people who actually know something about the domain. To clarify, it's pretty similar to the definition of a.

You are basically running a causal inference methodology on a set of observational data.

If you train a linear regression model on observational data and then look to the coefficients for insights, you have to be super super super careful. You are essentially measuring the correlation between each feature and target conditioned on all other features.

If you were using the model for only its forecasting accuracy of sales numbers, then you would be safer and don't need to satisfy as many assumptions.

But it sounds like you are trying to use the model to gather insights and potentially take actions, which is basically trying to run causal inference on a set of observational data which can easily go horribly wrong for a lot of reasons and give you completely backwards insights.

Unless you are able to perform some randomized controlled trials where you can perform random interventions on the key independent features then I would avoid analyzing the linear models coefficients too much. It can lead to bad results easily. Many people will use it to justify their own predetermined business strategies though >7B","3_1_8"

In theory, Im 100% on the Leo Breiman train that accuracy is all that matters and big, complex models are superior in all domains. 

In practice, only a few companies and business cases require NNs (outside the natural NN realms of speech/video/generative).

90% of companies do not have enough data, sufficiently complex businesses, or enough at stake to use NNs effectively. If youre a $1BN dollar company that cleans medical offices, maintains residential HVAC systems, or does freight forwarding, almost all your business cases will be best handled with simpler models.

If you've got 10 features and you know a priori 3 of them are irrelevant, then just keep it simple.

The size of the database matters less than the diversity. For an NN to be worth it, you need to push the number of features you're using and the types of features you're using. Once you get to 20, 30 features with a bunch of complicated interactions, then yea- an NN truly starts to shine. But having 20 years of hourly observations of one variable isnt worth much.

And I've actually seen businesses that think because they have 10 gigabytes worth of observations for one or two variables they have something valuable- they dont. Not for an NN.

To summarize, there are two typical issues I encounter irl:

1. The business only consistently collects data for a handful of features (i.e. POS, inventories, worker hours, etc.).

2. The business has a dataset that wont get fed reliable new data in the future

2 drives me nuts btw. You can build a big, one-off dataset with 50 features by paying for a bunch of 3rd party data. Thats great for a Kaggle competition.

But for business purposes what counts is the quality and reliability of the data you'll get in the future, not what you have right now. If you invest in an NN built on a dataset half of which will degrade in the future, then you might as well not have anything.

I'm NOT using greedy trees like standard CART though. GOSDT, MurTree, evTree, etc. all get pretty close to randomForest performance. If you're worried, run a dozen with different variables considered and average the two best ones. BAM, 15 variables (easy to put into prod, maintain and troubleshoot) that run in a handful of if-then statements will get you... pretty good performance. If you're not getting good performance you probably need to do more feature engineering. I have a case where 2 trees are matching an autoML XGBoost model that's using hundreds of variables. I actually BEAT the older model that required 6 different data sources using... only 1 data source.

An entire pricing is messed up because the linear regression is too weak to handle nuance. 

I am taking over a project and my old manager did regressions and only linear regressions and it was so bad. We have a messed up pricing and i am under a lot of stress.

So i would like to understand exactly how a linear regression would work. Because that shit did not work.  In fact it was so bad it couldnt segment properly in practice with any down stream optimization. 


And research actually goes about how regressions are very weak especially when data has a semblance of non linearity when their is an optimization component. Unless the data is super linear its fine, but when there is none then regression models absolutely fall apart in any data that has noise. 

Correct me if im wrong, but i think GBM, GAM, and MARS are exceptional good models because they are super robust.

Regression always deserves a chance, but tree based models are just built different and especially when you can have additive regression trees with business constraints will do the same job but with way better performance .

Maybe a neural network with one single layer and linear activation would be better than a linear regression, and interpretable enough. The ""neural network takes days to train"" part means that a wrong and overly complicated model is being used, e.g. a lstm, or something like that.

I understand that sometimes a simple model is better, but I think it's even better to understand the basics behind a model to be able to use it in the right ocassion. My point is that a neural network isn't overkill for this problem. If you want to use a neural network, you have to use the right neural network (or the right kernel for svm, the right link function for glm, etc).","30"

That's an important feature of simple models a lot of people miss

In many applications, simple models also tend to generalize better than complex ones. I'm reminded of the M competitions for forecasting, where dumb exponential smoothing just kept beating out all sorts of complicated methods. 

But I don't think linear regression is underrated really. A few people who always want the ""latest big thing"" and want to add a 0 to the end of their bill for doing something that a basic approach would work on might downplay it but people who are actually into producing useful results quickly have a pretty good idea why it's been a standard tool for so very long.

I often tend to use GLMs or other generalizations of regression, but it's not because I think that regression is not the bees knees; it's the very productive base on which much else relies.

There's a lot of tweaks on regression that are useful in various contexts. It's worth understanding the basic tools thoroughly.","42"

There are interactions, multiple flavours of non-linearities, resampling methods that go far beyond CV, GLM, GAM, penalization/shrinkage/regularization etc. etc. When a thoughtful and sensible linear model is fitted, it often competes with NNets in terms of out of sample accuracy and far outperforms the latter in terms of inference and explanatory (i,e, loosely causal) power.

As a business person first and a data junkie second, I always require a two main initialization steps with any type of predictive modeling.

First, we take all the suspect independent variables and run them in cross-tabs so that we can visually inspect any correlations. This is an important step because the algos, while novel and enticing, can't substitute for human understanding of common sense items that are organically generated in the data. Now, this does not mean you are finding causality in the correlations. You are making notes about linkages and possible explanations. It makes the team smarter and increases intuition around the direction you are headed.

Second, we always use an algorithm competition where we test  different prospective algos (including statistical methods) and question all of the results. Each one needs common sense interpretation and rerunning with different features or independent variables to see how the results change. By doing these two things, you systematize an approach to finding the best approach for predictive modeling.

It takes more time to do all of this, but it is well worth it because helps train team members to apply common sense and business understanding. It also creates alignment in execution.","91"

What is the difference between a data scientist today and a statistical analyst of yesterday? Not much, maybe data scientists use python now and Jupyter notebooks instead of R and markdown files. But the original vision for the data scientist as described by Harvards infamous article describing data science as the sexiest job was not just a rebranding of a statistical analyst. 

Data science made its debut in product. The product was always the algorithm that helped automate decision making. Recommender systems, translation, most recently chat bots. These are the things that originally got us excited about data science when we were laymen. Even in the infamous article Data Scientist: the Sexiest Job if the 21st Century, they primarily use the Linkedin recommender system as the tool that revolutionized the business. A product - not a report, not a stakeholder meeting, etc. 

When the decision scientist title existed, data science was still about predictive analytics. Decision scientists have effectively been swallowed by the data science brand as expectations of what data scientists should do shifted. This impacted the field turning data science into a primarily product geared position, to more of a consultant. This is what caused the huge expectation for data scientists to revolutionize business by looking at the data and uncovering hidden trends that would give business x a huge competitive advantage and blow the rest of the competition in the dust. Thats why companies use to be willing to pay so much money for a data scientist. We all know, for the vast majority of companies& it didnt work out that way. 

Before the ML Engineer title existed, data scientists were the ML guys. ML use to be the very core of data science and what differentiated them from traditional analysts. It was forward looking more than backward looking. Facebooks data science core team use to require research degrees in CS and/or Statistics to be in this core team. Other companies were less restrictive, but their core data scientists also researched and applied machine learning methodologies. It wasnt until Lyft entered the business that core data scientists began rebranding themselves as machine learning engineers and data science became more focused on analysis than product.

In 2018 Lyft singlehandedly changed the data science landscape. One if Lyfts core problems when hiring analytical staff was that due to the insane hype around data science, everyone was calling themselves a data scientist whether or not they had the skills to understand and apply machine learning. Lyft noticed that when they rebranded their unpopular BI roles as data scientists, these class of people that knew nothing about predictive analysis but called themselves data scientists would apply for these roles at mass. (They got paid more too given the new title) And those were exactly the type of people that Lyft needed. You know excel and can make some visualizations on tableau? Great welcome to the data science team. Now the data science umbrella composed mainly of BI analysts, data analysts, core data scientists, and everything in between. I believe at this time the Chief Data Scientist of some tech company infamously changed his instagram handle to read Machine Learning Engineer to differentiate himself from the new trend of what data science was becoming. 

How did this happen? Well, weve all been there or heard this story. You get onboarded as a data scientist at a company, the CEO has created a whole data science team, everyone can make a dashboard, everyone knows excel. There is no data engineering team, no product, no path forward. That is why the CEO hired so many data scientists anyway, to uncover his businesses future. Next month, and hundreds of thousands of dollars later the entire team is gutted, the CEO is fired, and the company is restarting their data practice from the bottom up starting with data engineers and software engineers. Cant code? Youre not in. Cant build products youre not in. Youre on the data science team? Great, how are those KPIs looking this month? Expectations of what data science was supposed to be were way too high. Data Scientists were expected to be business magicians and lead companies next to business leaders. Some did, most didnt. Now people have a more realistic perspective for the data science role as a non revolutionary analyst type role.

Whos to blame and whats the lesson? 
No ones to blame, this is the hype cycle that has existed with every new thing in business. Theres a whole Gen AI hype right now where everyone thinks AI is a chatbot. Maybe this is a cautionary tale to business leaders and aspiring data professionals to dig deeper beyond the hype so youre not left disillusioned. 

TL:DR;
Data science teams were mainly product focused machine learning teams until Lyft changed the landscape and rebranded their BI Analysts as Data Scientists. This rebranding was good for Lyft, but left many smaller companies disillusioned with Data Scientists as they began hiring BI Analyst types with the expectations that data science will revolutionize their company to become industry leaders. Those who pioneered advancements in machine learning under the data scientist title have rebranded themselves as machine learning engineers to differentiate themselves. Now the data science role is a non extraordinary analyst type role. Be careful around hype cycles so you too are not left disillusioned.","3"

I would never ask a candidate about a specific algorithm or statistical exercise because it's bloody useless.  

It's hard to be specific because the questions are set up to begin a conversation where experienced data scientists can probe without asking irrelevant questions.  

For example, if a candidate was telling us about a model development we may ask what considerations they made and I would expect to hear about assumptions of their algorithm then.  I wouldn't expect them to tell us the assumptions but that they are aware of them.

Having specific questions will bring you people who can't think critically because those who can will drop out and those who can't will feel at home.

There are a lot of roles in machine learning that require different skillsets.  
If you want to be on the frontier of researching new methods then a PhD in statistics, math, or computer science is a must.

If you like building libraries and are good with HPC and/or low level languages, you could become a software engineer at companies that produce these algorithms to optimize ML libraries.

If you like building data pipelines, infrastructure, monitoring existing models, optimizing a data scientist's code and deploying models in production, you can become a data engineer or ML Engineer.

If you want to integrate machine learning capabilities into applications and websites you can be a software engineer on a ML team.

If you want to apply models to new problems in notebooks and see which models work well for what problem you can be a machine learning engineer or data scientist (at companies where data scientists still experiment with ML).

These boundaries aren't very clear cut, but I see two tracks becoming extremely successful in ML right now:  
On one hand you have people at the edge of research at companies like OpenAI.  
On the other hand you have people with very good software engineering skills implementing research into libraries or building ML systems.   
One option boils down into getting a PhD (Although I would not recommend getting a PhD just to attain a ML Job, but if you have great research aptitude and are extremely interested in what you will be studying), the other option is to get a computer science or statistics bachelors degree, get your masters in statistics or computer science, and become a software engineer in a ML team.

A funny item too is that ""BI analyst"" also got rebranded to ""Data Analyst"". I think the expectations of data analysts these days are to have more python experience and work in an ad hoc environment. That split off people who were reporting analysts away from data analysts.

I feel like some data teams also started to have more software engineering components like ""how can we automate this powerpoint?"" (Python pptx ftw!) - that was a task that we had and it didn't need to scale fully, it just had to be used by our commercial teams. So data teams were also creating somewhat janky tools, that worked great for what they were. This enabled the team to engage with new tools outside SQL and it became a way to differentiate yourself amongst candidates (data wrangling experience).

Some tools started to be created to replicate some basic analysis which was great, then we could focus on harder problems for the business!

I think what's tough for people these days is not having this organic ramp up with tools they are asked to master. Like why learn python? Why become familiar with R? 

My company now is looking for people with dbt experience, I think that will be a new common target. However, this is for data / software engineers to have that experience not data scientists or analysts like I would expect from even recently.","3_2"

Hard disagree here. Understanding difficult tools is, well, difficult. Figuring when to use the big guns is relatively simple.

I think the number one reason why otherwise impressive candidates don't get hired is that they lack a complete skill set. 

We get a LOT of resumes for entry-level positions where the applicant has advanced training in CS, DS, and/or stats. But during the interview it's very clear that they have no idea how to apply that knowledge to real world problems and/or can't effectively communicate the results. As I often say, it's not what you know that matters; rather, it's how you let other people know what you know. 

I'd rather hire a good natural problem solver who can present and write up findings who only understands OLS regressions because it's easier to teach them the subset of technical skills that they'll actually use rather than someone who knows every technical skill out of the sun but has no clue with respect to non-technical skills. The latter are a dime a dozen. When I hire, I imagine where the person will be in 6-9 months after onboarding and training. I don't necessarily want to hire someone who starts out a little bit ahead but has a ceiling because non-technical skills hold them back. 

At least for my team, writing is probably the most important non-technical skill.

Currently, the responsibilities of my roles is to guide marketing strategies with data, evaluate effectiveness of a product feature, design experiments and AB tests. A lot of my time is spent on writing SQL, building dashboards, occasionally doing hypo testing or clustering. A lot of these already largely overlap with your description of a data scientist.

Apart from ML, what else should I focus on so I can develop enough skills for a data scientist job?

This overlap could be higher or lower based on the different flavor of data science jobs in the industry. There are broadly three flavors of data scientist jobs: Applied ML Data Scientist, Analytics Data Scientist and Experimentation/Causal-Inference Data Scientist. 

The first thing you need to do is to decide what flavor of data scientist you want to be. People with social science experience tend to dominate the analytics and experimentation/causal-inference flavors because it aligns with their training. But nothing stops you from becoming an ML Data Scientist too. Most entry-level applicants fail to decide their preferred flavor of data science which negatively impact their application experience because they throw apps at every data scientist job advertised on the internet. The ones that get offers become surprised when their data science jobs do not align with their expectations. To prevent getting this experience, decide what flavor of data scientist you want to be before sending an app. 

For Applied ML Data Scientist jobs, the overlap is on the low side (20-30%). The missing piece is predictive and prescriptive analysis. You can get this experience by creating a predictive (ML/deep learning) or prescriptive (optimization) task from your current responsibilities. Can you predict the right audience for your marketing campaigns? Can you optimize your marketing spend by reducing budget from one segment and increasing budget in another segment? You can build out your use case and build a POC. If your result is good, your stakeholders might like it and implement it. 

For analytics DS, the overlap is ~90-100%. You can apply directly to those roles. You have the right experience.

For experimentation/causal inference DS, the overlap is 50%. The missing piece is building more efficient A/B testing processes for your team. Are there flaws in your current A/B test designs or tools that is impacting your results and affecting your business decisions? Are there better A/B test designs that can produce more accurate results for your team?","32_1"

Bingo. My company hired a real estate agent to manage the AI stuff (like actually a real estate agent who did a STEM masters degree and worked as a sales engineer for some kinda AI snake oil startup). They got shuffled under IT in a re-org. Thing is, our IT department has zero modern engineering capabilities. They barely understand what this stuff is, have zero competency with modern languages, tools, frameworks, APIs. And as typical, the IT has little to no business domain knowledge to effectively identify where any of this would work.Â 

Anyways, I expressed interest in broadening my experience in the business domains a year or so ago - specifically mentioning accounting and finance as my weakest points. Managed to get my self nested under the CFO next to finance and risk/compliance. Im letting IT take heat for the fact they cant even get us data from source A to warehouse B in less than a 1-year turnaround time per source and while watching them flail trying to manage AI with zero technical staff trained in this stuff.Â 

Meanwhile Im looking at where I can apply more tangible and material impact even if relatively non technical and not directly data science. Little stuff over the next year or so while the AI shit cools off and hits the trough of whatever in the hype curve: $100k saved in efficiency if directors werent copy pasting data between excel reports to report to executives weekly kinda thing, survival mode that hinted years ago wed see massive defaults soon but no one looked at then but had they, wed be in a different spot now and better if I had time to make it production worthy, AB test some product designs across segments of customers, stuff I can tie dollars to and that smooth out the bumps in our management cycles.Â ","2_3"

We now turned this template into a prompt instruction for ChatGPT, so it generates an answer that is close to what we expected in the template.

3. I give ChatGPT (or whatever the model) the string with the data + the question, e.g:  
""I am customer ABC. I have the following order(s). Order 1 has: ID is '#1001', Purchase date is '2024-01-01', which has 5 items, Expected arrival date: ""2024-01-05"". Order 2 has: ID is '#1002', Purchase date is '2024-01-02', which has 10 items, Expected arrival date: ""2024-01-07"".

One thing to note here is that if you have a small amount of data on the customer, it might be sufficient to just give chatGPT the question along with everything you know about the customer and ask it to answer questions based on that info. If you have a large amount of data on the customer, or if you need to to answr questions about your business, you'll need to a way to find the ""answer"" in your database and then supply that context to chatgpt and have it answer the question based on the supplied knowledge. This is called ""Retrieval Augmented Generation"" or RAG and it's the hot new way people are bulking up the abilities of these models. The current approach most people are taking is to ""vectorize"" your database and do a cosine similarity search for the most appropriate document. There should be plenty out there to explain how to do all of that.

All problems are solved ~~but on the internet!~~ with AI!

Give it a few years and then the shine will wear off and senior executives will have finally learned how AI works. There will be no more kingdoms to conquer and Alexander will weep.

RAG relies heavily on retrieving the right document, so you need to make sure your retriever is working well. (Easier said than done in some cases.) And depending on what kind of retriever you use, you'll also have to consider the context size. (Can your model generate based on the full document or does it work better on smaller chunks like a paragraph?) If you find that the issue isn't with the retriever but with generation, you should consider fine-tuning, particularly if your data is very different from what the model saw in pretraining. The issue here usually is getting enough good quality data to fine-tune on.","20_1_1"

How about working for an organization that is restricted by HIPAA and tons of other regulations that I've never even heard of before I started working there, that literally does everything the *approved way*, and that approval may take months for anything more or less serious?

Interesting enough, it's actually getting *worse* and *stricter* over time. I guess every time large data breach happens somewhere, our regulators send another team of security auditors our way that restict/block something new that has not been restricted before.

I guess, job security here is pretty solid (caveat: unless you screw up and actually do something that *even remotely resembles a chance that some data may be leaked*), but the overall environment is exactly the opposite to ""*GenAI hype everywhere*"". 

And yes, we still process fixed-width batch text files on a daily basis.

There is a Fee of currently about 7Â¬ per prescribed medication package.

If the medication is less than 7Â¬, then I pay the regular price. If I'd have a very low income, the feed would be waived.

If the medicine is more expensive, I still just pay the 7Â¬ fee.

When someone in your family needs a medication listed for 850Â¬ as uninsured price, that's a pretty good deal. The same medicine is listed by drugs.com for ""from 6,400$"", about 7-times as expensive. Don't want to give more details over privacy concerns.

Curiously, I couldn't reproduce similar differences when trying to look at examples, that don't affect my personal environment. For instance, for Insulin Isophane, I find a price of [60$/10ml](https://imgur.com/a/HfXMQZW) and [90Â¬/30ml = 30Â¬/10ml](https://imgur.com/a/aiu2koj), resulting in ""only"" a roughly factor 2 price difference. 

On the other hand, for Desloratadine, a standard medicine for allergies including common hay fever, I usually buy for about 6Â¬ for 30 pieces (about 0.20Â¬ per piece) matching the [online price](https://www.shop-apotheke.at/arzneimittel/A3903027/desloratadin-genericon-5-mg.htm) roughly, coming out to 0.20Â¬/5mg. The comparison portal lists prices as low as [0.06Â¬/5mg](https://www.medizinfuchs.de/desloratadin.html?params%5Border%5D=baseprice_asc&amp;params%5Bview%5D=list&amp;params%5Bword_suggestions%5D%5Bunits%5D%5B0%5D=ST&amp;params%5Bfilter_price%5D=), but at that point it's not worth buying online from a company I don't know. For the US, I find a price of [1.40$/5mg](https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/desloratadine), more in line with the factor-7 seen for the expensive medication.

Americans pay just as much in *taxes* for healthcare as someone in the UK does for the NHS. Americans then pay premiums on top of that for insurance. However, if you have to use services, you can expect to pay even more - even if they're in network. There are out-of-pocket costs, that have a limit, but dependent on the insurance policy that can be somewhere in the region of $4-10k. So if you get hit by a car, you pay tax, you pay insurance premium, then you can pay $10k on top.

Then if you go out of network, say because you have to get a diagnostic test done that isn't in-network, you can expect to pay even more, because those of out-of-pocket costs don't go to the aforementioned $10k limit.

And whoever talks about how good the US medical system is, go look up healthcare cost per capita and life expectancy.","4_4_1_2"

There are different deductibles if you go to a out of network doctor yes.

So yes making 3x what I would make in the UK is worth it for me even with higher healthcare costs .

The job will come with a defined benefits pension, which would be the government alpha scheme. Unfortunately there's a big misunderstanding that the employer ""contributes"" money into your pension. This only matters if you wish to transfer your pension benefits from a defined benefits scheme. You would be crazy (and probably stupid) to do so. What's annoying is that the government jobs also advertise they ""contribute"" these amounts too. 

This job, if part of the alpha scheme, would pay 2.32% of your salary as a retirement payment from retirement until you die. So if you earned Â£50K, you'd get Â£1160 per year until you die. That Â£1160 will also increase by 1% each subsequent year you're working in a job that is part of this pension scheme. So after year two, that Â£1160 will become Â£1171.60. Of course you will also add in another 2.32% of year two's salary. All defined benefit pensions are also bullet proofed from inflation as they are adjusted for it. Last year alone, due to high inflation, my NHS pension was increased by 10.1%.

https://ai.usajobs.gov/search/results/?cmco=AI&amp;s=startdate&amp;sd=desc&amp;p=1&amp;k=artificial%20intelligence

And supervisors and that sort of thing are in the 130k, 140k USD range.   But if you're in Washington DC or maryland those are relatively high cost of living compared to most of the UK. 

One thing to keep in mind here is doing a straight currency conversion isn't how this works.  In 5 years the UK GBP has gone from 1.4 USD, to about 1.08, to about 1.27.  Which is down significantly from 2 in 2007.  That doesn't mean a change of buying power by 40% or 100%.  You're paying local costs for labour, healthcare (or healthcare taxes in the UK), food, insurance etc.  If the pound goes back up 20 or 30% you don't get more money, and if goes down 20% you aren't getting less.

Power points don't scale, they're created for 30 minutes of talking, then put in the dumpster forever. It's too high level. A well-written, fully detailed report that is meant to influence others will actually be read by a wide audience (sometimes 1+ years after your wrote it). This is how DS works at places like Meta, and I can't emphasize enough to you just how valuable their ecosystem of notes is. Sure, not all notes are widely read, but it's well worth the effort.

A report is also for the writer as much as much as it is for the audience. Writing your ideas down, in fine-grained detail, forces you to confront hidden assumptions, etc.. Power points encourage everyone involved, especially the presenter, to engage in superficial thinking.","1_8_1_1"

Powerpoint enables visualisations to accompany text, its like a higher bandwith and higher fedelity information transfer....

Most people write crap reports anyway.

I like a pyramid structure, where the first thing you see is the small high level summary, then a more lengthy follow up with some pro's and cons of the summary and most important additional info with links to sources further in the report. Leading to the largest part of the detailed report with the nitty gritty details.

You should probably never have a slide with bullet points. Never use a slide content template. If you dont have a better idea of what that slide needs to accomplish than picking from a list of templates, you dont know what youre trying to say yet.

What is worse, neither can most of people. Your teammates, your direct reports, the fresh out of uni newbie - half of them *can't read*.

Unlike a school, where students are suggested things to read, at work the bosses may request that you write a report. Or perhaps, writing reports are a given for certain types of work. In these cases, you need to write amazing reports for it to make a difference.

If you have written a report, and the decision makers didn't get it, then it is partially on you. Labour over every sentence structure, hierarchical structure, (un)intentional page breaks, number translations, and rhetorical devices.

- Toolstoo is an amazing PPT plug-in similar to internal consulting company tools. It's $20 for a lifetime license and just insane value for the money. Saves so much time in PPT

- Toolstoo is PC only. Another good cheap / free one is Brightslide which is PC and MAC

- Get really good with all the key PPT tools both native and in Toolstoo

- These include Align, Distribute, Bring to Front / Back, Making Same Size / Width / Height, Adjoin, Stretch, Keeping / Fixing aspect ratios, etc. 

- Learn how to use tables. You can use a table and format it so it doesn't look like a table. Super helpful for presenting info in a structured grid, often easier to format than aligning and distributing lots of individual objects. You can also overlay other shapes and objects on top of the underlying table

- With tables I usually never use the built in PPT themes. I always start by selecting the basic no fill with black borders theme. And then format from there

- Learn Shift + Mouse Drag to move things on a fixed X / Y axis

- Learn Ctrl + Mouse Drag to make quick copies of objects

- Learn Ctrl + Shift + Mouse Drag to make quick copies of objects while moving them on a fixed X / Y axis

- Learn Shift + Corner Mouse Drag to resize objects while keeping the aspect ratio fixed

- Learn to use Before or After paragraph spacing, instead of using blank lines between paragraphs. And just stick to using one of Before or After, not both

- Learn to adjust text box / shape / table margins to manipulate small spaces, very effective when you're tight on space. Try to always keep the margin symmetry between either top / bottom or right / left to avoid text looking wonky 

- Copy, copy, copy. Being quick and good at PPT is all about reusing and copying the same stuff or making different variations of the same stuff over and over again

- E.g., Headings, just find 2-3 different variations and use them consistently

- E.g., Callouts, just use 1-2 different variations and use them consistently

- E.g., Numbered shapes, just find 2-3 different variations and use them consistently

- E.g., Bullets, create a standard bullet text box placeholder with three levels in one of your slide master layouts, then just reuse that text box consistently whenever you need bulleted text. And if you need to do bullets in other shapes and tables, then just format them the exact same way. Bullets are actually pretty annoying. I used to have a tool from my consulting company that fixed bullets, but now that I don't work there still hunting for a way to do that 

- Add custom guidelines (not actual shape lines, it's like a separate overlay from the right click menu) to the left / right sides of the slide where you want the content to be framed. Keep your content between those guidelines as often as possible, will look much cleaner. Can do for top / bottom as well but usually I have a header and footer that provides that guide

- Start looking at the slide as a grid, whether large or small grid, you'll start seeing how you can manipulate space

- Learn to customize and setup your quick access toolbar, and save backups, so you can restore if it disappears

- Learn how to keep your Slide Master clean

- Learn how to copy slides and objects from other files without screwing up your working file Slide Master. Usually you always want to paste in ""using destination theme"" or just as plain text and reformat, almost never paste in ""using keep source format""

- Stick to the PPT theme in the slide master, i.e., use consistent fonts and colors

- Be super concise with your writing. Do NOT write like an academic or college paper. Break everything down into short, punchy sentences. Almost NEVER write paragraphs with multiple sentences. Make almost everything direct, active voice, almost never passive voice. Write exactly what the key takeaways on the slide should be, and nothing more. Cut filler words ruthlessly. You don't even need to write full sentences, people absorb and process things better if they're broken down into short, specific points. This paragraph is example of how NOT to write in PPT, too many sentences together

- OK, I'm running out of steam. Final thing, when you see good presentations, try to get a copy of them. Save one version as a PDF. Then save another version as a blank PPT that still has the same slide master, but you've gotten rid of the content. Then use the PDF as a guide and try to recreate good slides from scratch. This is a really helpful exercise, because you can't just copy / paste from the PDF, it forces you to go through the process of creating things yourself and having to learn how to do the design work yourself","9"

Praise fucking be. So much time is wasted trying to account for every minor detail that the punchline gets lost. If someone needs more detail they can ask or set a followup call to dice deeper. Generally people just want the so what / what can we do about it / what does does this mean for me. McKinsey pyramid principle.

What size text would you be able to read from across a room? What font is best if you had dyslexia etc.? What colours would you be able to see if you were colour blind, etc?

 You don't  have to include low res images crammed in with text on the same slide. Either have a chart / infographic as a whole slide to itself, or send it to everyone ahead of the presentation in the format you prefer, and have a slide note to remind you to ask everyone to open that document now and look at it.

Resisted powerpoint heavily, largely because I was bad at it. I looked down at the 'good at powerpoint' people, and also viewed them as 'creative' types that were investing fruitless energy in an overly subjective area (particularly those that focused on unique / high effort fancy visual design).

10 years of consulting experience later, and I consider communication skills (including deck/powerpoint creation) to be one of the stronger skills in my toolkit. Clients comment on it regularly, and senior execs ask for my help to better communicate to their stakeholders.

Here are some tips that helped me:  
1. It's not about making visually 'unique', 'creative' slides. Many people are good at this, but it's not where the actual value add comes from - it's a red herring if you're starting out. If I really need to give my decks a final 'professional touch' I outsource that to a designer or analyst that's good at that, but that knows nothing about the content, and they make things look prettier after the fact. Focus on the content, structure, and clarity of communication. 90% or more of slides I've ever created follow one of 5 or 6 content structures, and most of those are 'thinly disguised tables' structurally.

2. Strong powerpoint creation follows the same rules as other written communication. Be clear in who your audience is, objective of the presentation, and what your key messages to support that objective for that audience are. Write out your outline of main point and supporting points, use that to shape the structure of the deck (or slide). Taglines should be able be able to be read top-to-bottom through the presentation (ignoring everything else on the slides) and reader should still be able to walk away with the key point &amp; supporting points you wanted them to leave with. Follow the pyramid principle (lots of good examples/content out there) - this applies at multiple scales within the presentation - both to the overall structure of the presentation, as well as individual slides, or the writing within a slide.

3. Consider purpose of the document itself. An offline deliverable that will be shared offline and have a life of its own needs to really stand on its own and contain all of the important context so it is not misrepresented. A slide for presentation support that will be spoken over should be much less busy and full, so as to not distract from the speaker's key points (or highlighting the key points/data/output). Similar rule applies to seniority or background of audience, level of technical ability, etc.

4. Strong presentations are often dependent on strong writing skills, which are themselves dependent on strong structured problem solving skills. If your thinking is unstructured and chaotic, without following a logical flow, your writing and presentation will as well. Always think about how your points connect (e.g. A causes B which results in C, as evidenced by D) rather than just info dumping. Cut the fat and any language that isn't contributing to your goal.

5. QA your work. Put your presentation on fullscreen yourself and present to yourself in your head. Critically evaluate whether your point is coming across, and whether any part of your presentation/wording looks sloppy. Are you using 12 different fonts or too many colors for no reason? Simplify is almost always the answer. Keep color schemes, fonts, misalignments, inconsistencies, 'jiggle' to a minimum, as these will distract from your presentation, and also make things look less 'professional' and weaken your credibility (fairly or not). As per point #1, you don't need to get super 'unique' or 'creative' here (because that is not where the value add comes from - you just want to do enough to avoid pulling attention away from your points): use a simple monochrome palette rather than rainbow skittle vomit that makes your slide look like a bad LSD trip. Get familiar with the 'align object' tools in PPT and use them liberally - doesn't take long before you start just doing it subconsciously with almost no brainpower required.","20"

One is, don't overthink it, it's a tool - try to get proficient with it. Get advice from your colleagues and ask them why they're doing what they're doing. Do they enjoy it, do they do it for the audience? Why do there's think the audience needs this?Â 


You overcome fear by developing a better understanding and by coming into contact with something on a regular basis. Powerpoint is no different.


&gt; trying to make everything line up the way it should even though it never really does--all to see my beautiful dynamic dashboards reduced to static cutouts.Â 


You might want to think about what the aim of the presentation should be. Is it too showcase beauty - or is it to get people to understand something and take that newly developed understanding with them?



I'm not saying beauty doen't have a place, it does. You're proud of your dashboard, probably rightly so. I'm saying there's different aspects that your audience might also value and value higher. Personally, I prefer a static slide a) because I'm used to it and b) because it's a fixed representation that I can refer to.Â 


I've seen enough people jump through a barely rehearsed presentations where their ""story"" didn't really have a direction. You can stop, ask to elaborate, ask critical question - a static slide helps there.Â 


The other other benefit for me is the following: when I'm a meeting I'm likely thinking about my current project, maybe I had to rush to reach your meeting or I'm otherwisedistracted by something outside our online meeting because 'stuff happens'. SomeÂ ofÂ itÂ mightÂ beÂ myÂ fault but my point is that generally your audience might not always be fully attentive.



If the presenter shows me concepts and numbers from a topic that I'm not familiar with I'll already struggle with following them. If they then have a (highly) dynamic presentation I'll probably get lost because I often do not have the mental capacity to follow both new content and a new presentation style.


Powerpoint is a standard tool but if you want to move away from that within a given it group you'll need to understand, first, what makes it successful and how you could achieve what you want to achieve within the confines that it gives you.Â 


Otherwise you're seeing not from a point of proficiency but from a point of, well, taste - which is generally an okay stanceÂ but not if your audience gets lost.


Try to get better at it, it might be tedious but repeated exposure and better understanding of why it's used will help reduce your fear of it. >Ã¡","32"

I use Google Slides, but I think the objections are likely the same there.)

One reason I think ours are (IMO) very successful is that the slides are almost entirely simple and graphic -- photos, simple charts, images of details from interesting historical records. Usually one thing filling the entire screen. We really try to minimize slides that have much of any text. And the words we are saying explain what people are seeing. While preparing the visuals takes time too, we have really cut down on formatting time but also creating a template of a few styles and colors and sticking to them.

There is a significant caveat here -- just showing images can be an accessibility concern, as it's hard for anyone who can't hear us to follow along, and it's difficult when someone asks us to ""just please share your deck."" So for this approach you really need to separately make notes about what you are saying available separately. I rely heavily on the ""Speaker notes"" feature as I am presenting, so I can export those along with my slides when requested.

I think the good(?) news is that if you find slides boring, others likely will too, and you can use that instinct to hopefully break out of the gravity of lots of bullet points and complicated graphics. Of course, if your company or institutional culture doesn't reward that .... sigh, that's hard. But others will thank you, secretly or otherwise!","40"

I was just like you when I started, I despised it. 

I started hating it less when I learned about rhetoric and what a good ppt looks like. Ppt is there to support you talking, so it has to be lean. A really good example are the old Steve Jobs talks for the IPhone release. Basically no text at all. No fancy symbols or bs like that.

When I create ppt today, I have just a hand full of really short bullet points, 3-5 usually and only if necessary to convey my point, and often visuals, which usually are a single large picture or graphic. As stupid as it may sound but one of the most important things is to keep your audience entertained. You talk to them for a reason, either because you want them to give you something or to remember something. In both cases, it is important that they give you their full attention and/or remember you. So make it entertaining. In most of my talks/presentations there is something humorous, just something you can smile about a little. Like when explaining NNs to someone I usually use the goofiest pictures of animals I can find. It's a complex problem and you risk losing people. A little funny thing like that bring back their attention. Same goes for the other visuals I use. If you stare at a wall of text in black and white it's just boring. You want people to hold on to something and you want them to listen but not read.

People get used to the template and therefore spend more time on the content than on perusing the header, footer and style queues. It works at conferences and even customer presentations in that it helps establish a brand. With a nice clean simple template, consistent fonts it makes for ensuring those who are not so good at creating decks have at least a consistent basis to start from. It also means you can pull pages you need from other presentations easily or make it easy for those doing the presentation to clean it up if it was prepared by someone less familiar with PowerPoint.

Actually I prefer the Google Slides product as it allows collaborative efforts in creating presentations and is pretty much as straightforward to use as PowerPoint. Youngsters leaving school or College even are coming out with Google tools experience and less experience in Microsoft Office products due to the pervasiveness of Chromebooks in education. The average graduating high school student leaves with 7 or 8 years of Google tools experience and about zero of Microsoft Office tools. As a runner up would be Apples products as Macs are pervasive in school computer labs and Macs and iPads have the Apple office automation tools installed by default.

Some of these alternative tool sets are not quite as sophisticated as PowerPoint, though Google offers a useful team working environment, but that lack of complexity might be in fact a positive thing - enabling a more consistent brand image.

As someone raised on PowerPoint but having used Chromebooks in education for the last 9 years I would pick the Google alternative every time. The features that are missing, I doubt I would hardly ever use. The same goes for Google docs. The only Microsoft office automation tool I think really shines and is hard to replace as the alternatives dont really stand up is Microsoft Excel. Im afraid to my mind the Libreoffice suite isnt quite there yet, its man machine interface is just too visually confusing for my mind, but that might just be a lack of experience with it.","77"

From there, there's a few paths 

1.) Get good at PowerPoint - make even more compelling visuals, e.g. become the stakeholder 

2.) Put a lower amount of effort on visuals, optimize for folks pulling data and making their own charts.

3.) Get out of dashboard work and do something else. 

Given your post, my advice would be a mix of 2 &amp; 3.

Given no priors, the best would be option 1. The degree to which an insight is good, is the degree to which it can be communicated. In fact, socializing insights is 80% of the battle. That's why so much work goes into it.

Risk analysis is seen as a vitamin in the sense that if you staff it well, things won't get any worse. But it's to sell someone something that will maintain a baseline if an org is hemorrhaging productivity, value, or talent and money can be thrown toward stopping the bleeding.

I literally had at least one recruiter tell me this was their reasoning.

Exactly.  

Minmaxing the interview process involves reducing as much noise as possible.  (This isn't just my opinion, this is a topic that has been extensively researched.)  When the domain is so large trivia of any sort becomes luck based.  They get an advantage if they recently studied that topic, giving juniors a heads up over seniors.  When an interview is luck based you're maximizing noise, not minimizing it.

The less noise an interview has the easier it is to compare candidates.  The secret sauce to a good interview then becomes doing the easiest non-trivia based interview you can figure out how to create.  One that both tests the candidate for competency but also is so easy it might feel embarrassing to ask it.  From there you get a large pool of people who pass your interviews, but the ones that shine both groove socially with your culture but also go the extra mile on the technical.  They show or do something beyond the original question being asked, a sort of hidden 102 solution.  Just beware of trivia based 102 additions to the problem, it needs to be truly creative.

It helps to keep in mind DS is a research role.  It's about being able to learn, not about coming in knowing everything.  So, questions should be researched based, like them walking through figuring out how to solve a problem.  Maybe going on Google with them and acting as a team to solve some mystery.  Something like that.  If presentation matters, give them an over the weekend stupidly simple notebook problem.  Ask them to do some EDA and plot what they see, then have an interview where they tell a story of what they see.  Maybe have the 102 part be the world's most basic feature engineering.  If your tech stack is difficult, like you use Spark, maybe have a weekend Spark based notebook or something similar that uses the prerequisite skills.

This is how you do a proper data science interview.  It sounds underwhelming, but that's to its benefit.  That's the point, it's supposed to be.  You're not blocking people from passing the technical, you're seeing socially how well the groove with you while solving a problem.","7_2"

The take-home was reasonable, and when it came to the final round (where I at that point had other offers I needed to respond to), they fast-tracked me past a python/SQL test. All in all, the process told me that a company I was already excited about was also a collegial place to work and a good fit for my skills and way of thinking.

It took a lot of time, including dropping out from some interview processes I thought were bad or just a mutually poor fit and declining a couple offers before I even had any others in hand. But in the end I got to a sensible company, and it was worth it. Those bad interviews/bad companies weren't a waste of time, they were part of the sampling process that I needed to get through to more likely draw a winner.

This is, of course, not very helpful advice when you're desperate for a position. I had the luxury of having a stable position during the interview process, so plenty of time to get through the slog without worrying about my next paycheck. But OP - it sounds like you've got at least a bit of time, too. It might be less frustrating to view this as bad companies weeding themselves out for you, so you can focus your energy on the handful that seem more sensible.","9"

I forking hate all the irrelevant DS trivia questions. As you point out, they dont measure anything meaningful. If anything the only folks who will do better on those kinds of questions are A) cheating by using tools to look up answers to questions theyre asked live, or B) have recently graduated from college, or C) have assembled a flashcard deck of hundreds of those questions and answers and studied their butts off. 

The irony is that this kind of trivia is asked for SENIOR roles, of people who have years of experience (I have a decade in DS), yet more junior folks will do better on it. 

And hiring managers love the ILLUSION of a senior/principal level DS just knowing all that shit off the top of their head.

I think its ridiculous. Nobody in the real world needs to remember all that academic stuff off the top of their heads. We all have the experience and training to look things up if and when theyre relevant and do the work correctly. 

Anyway, yes, I completely concur that its stupid. And utterly exhausting and frustrating. 

And then theres how it seems like theres a lot less appreciation for traditional data science now. A significant percentage of DS job posts are looking for folks with extensive deep learning, AI, NLP, and LLM/genAI expertise. I think this is dumb because its just the same thing weve seen with every other overly hyped technology. Remember blockchain? Its a good solution to a limited set of problems, but EVERYONE started trying to hire blockchain expertise and just shoehorn it in everywhere. Same thing is happening with AI these days. Companies are veering hard into AI, yet they have little to no strategy for what the heck theyre going to do with it. And weve all seen numerous examples already of costly AI initiatives which were complete duds. E.g., many of the AI-enabled website builders or Descripts (if youre familiar with that software) AI integrations. Its like  world has momentarily lost their minds and thrown out the usual effective approaches: define strategy, design product using UI/UX good practices, etc. 

 Anyway, I feel like hiring in DS is more broken than its ever been. Many roles require up to 10 rounds of interviews (Ive started saying no to any with more than 6), theres little in common from one company to the next (so study and prep requires an inefficient shotgun approach), and base pay is abysmal.

I feel like whatever is going on out there has radically reduced our earning power. After being with an organization for almost seven years its quite likely I was under compensated, and should be able to expect a healthy pay bump in my next role, right? Nope! Its looking like my real earning potential DECLINED. I WAS making $150K (with a decade of experience as a Senior DS for a tech company), and now many roles Im seeing are offering $120-$150K, even for management roles (manager or DS) or principal/lead DS roles. Its insane to me. Ill probably take the first role I can get an offer for and then keep looking for a higher paying role.","14"

Therefore, the limited number of jobs available end up erecting high barriers in order to filter out all the applicants.  And these barriers come in the form of grad school trivia, leetcode, take homes, etc etc.

I sympathize with this but tech is sort of unique in that there's

a) high comp, high desirability

b) basically no hard credentialing or gatekeeping

c) no public record of performance

Which taken together, creates this confluence of events.

A final thought: I noticed that you specialize in causal inference.  Unfortunately, there aren't many casual inference jobs out there; it is pretty niche, so I'm not surprised you didn't get any questions related to that, and instead got more generic DS questions suited for more generic DS jobs.

You are looknig at the job interview all wrong. Its not a ""yes you are good enogh you get the job"" vs ""No you are good enough you don't get the job"". In truth most interviews you'll go to you end up in the class ""Yes you are good enough, but so is this other candidate that we had a better feeling about, so you don't get it"". 

We bring in maybe 10 candidates for some positions, and all or most are decent enough to get the job otherwise they wouldn't pass early screening. But we only have one position to fill. So which do we chose? Well, the one we have the best feeling about, which includes their ability to solve a broad range of problems, or just probing their attitudes and reactions about them. 

We recently had a candidate come in for a position who answered to a question ""I don't know that, but if a task required it, I would definately be able to learn that"", and that was a **perfectly** good answer. Another candidate on a different question gave us an answer that amounts to ""I should't have to know that, and you are stupid for asking me that, because I don't think the position should deal with that, and your organisation is propably set up all wrong"".

Cause that guy is familiar with the differences, and since he knows it, projecting that its an important piece of knowledge for an average DS job =

I think its a waste of time for an interview question and there are much better ways to gauge technical skill.

Maybe its applicable to his role.  But its a pretty niche area of data science if they are worried about  the technical differences between 2 different tree based models in their day to day work","20_3_1"

I am not sure what that is...but I have heard that if you enter into core, it's better to stay there. Sure IT jobs are slightly more well paid, but also high risk jobs.

Anyways, the problem with post-30s transition is industry is likely to be biased. You might find some small companies and founders willing to take a chance. My ex-boss was one of them.","42_1"

However, imo, you are looking at totally different sectors that are nowhere remotely similar, atleast not from my pov.

It's possible if you are targeting a company who works say - BP or Shell - and use your tech skills for different divisions. But if you are looking to apply the same set of skills, into say, predicting amount of oil in an unexplored region etc... I think that's gonna be much harder.

Sometimes we were able to use them directly in user-facing graphics, but sometimes we would switch to something like d3 or Datawrapper for final output, since those were our main front-facing tools. We tend to shy away from too much interactivity anyway, so there weren't a lot of downsides to that.

I really like it for data exploration and prototyping. Once you get the syntax down, you can rapidly do a wide variety of things -- pretty much all of the things I want to do. And I like that you can easily export PNG and SVG from it.

What takes a little getting used to is that ultimately you are writing VegaLite under the hood, so sometimes for documentation you have to look up VegaLite stuff instead of Altair and then translate it a bit. But that has gotten much less frequent over the years. I also like that it can be easily integrated into my Python notebooks.

So if you are already doing data analysis with Python, I'd recommend. If you're using something like R or Javascript for that part it might not be the right fit.","10_1_1"

But I gotta say, you will pry matplotlib out of my cold, dead hands. It's just so gosh darn flexible. Couple of examples:

You can't set a starting radius in polar barplot in plotly. A plot like this is very hard (if not impossible) in plotly:
https://www.kymat.io/gallery_2d/plot_scattering_disk.html#figure-reproduction

imshow interpolations in matplotlib have no parallel in anything else. Altair ""heatmaps"" are a joke in comparison.

Probably many other examples. I normally don't struggle at all to create complex plots in matplotlib. At the very least I know no matter what it is, it's possible. Can't say the same for the other plots.

Where matplotlib sucks/struggles is interactivity in an HTML setting. So probably not the best for dashboards. But then again who cares about dashboards... business ppl want a ppt with screenshots lol.","29"

They don't have good names from what I've heard, but let's call them 'theoretical DS' and 'practical DS'.  


The theoretical DS is leaning more towards ML engineering. They keep up-to-date on the latest developments within the field, make complex models that solve business problems, etc., but they have limited amounts of stakeholder management and domain expertise. They are usually depth-first - they have a general overview of the DS field, but are specialized within computer vision, NLP, etc.  


The practical DS is leaning more towards Data analyst. Often called product data scientists, they are usually more generalist and spend more time with stakeholders, understanding the domain, and communicating the results of models. Here, the model they end up using is much less important than which problem they are solving. Contrary to the theoretical DS, it's not really clear which problem should be solved, or how it should be solved. While the theoretical DS knows they have to make a recommender system, and the difficulty is in how to tune it and make it extremely good, the practical DS requires more collaboration with PMs and others to figure out what to do.  


The days of data scientists being in positions requiring the latter but doing the former are (mostly) over, because a lot of companies have realized that a fancy neural network doesn't necessarily equal an impact on the bottom line.

I mean even for something like Linear Regression, we spend time learning about Heteroskedasticity or introducing nonlinearity, but then in industry we might often hand-wave those all aside and run the simple Linear Regression as our output model. That is, when putting together simple models after cleaning the data, it feels like we're not doing enough to warrant the job functionality...hence the ""imposter syndrome"".

Setting a seed is good for the reproduction of the results that you got but in the generalizability side of things what's the point - if you're just trying to run the code the same as someone else you should get the same results but if your argument is that the results are generalizable then the seed shouldn't change the results in statistically significant way.

Yes you should have a git with everything backed up and well documented.

Not every model can be evaluated with monte carlo - did they use monte carlo in ChatGPT? I think that's inaccurate.

The ""general steps"" outlined are the same, when you get into details of the project there are certain things that you need to do but you research and you should research them and pick them up - but there isn't a ""one size fits all approach"".  Projects are limited by budgets and timelines. Not everything needs a deep learning model, typically, a linear or logistic regression or random forrest will get you great results with pretty low effort. The time required to develop a deep learning model for most projects isn't worth the cost. 

If the task is to improve upon an existing model typically it has less to do with the modeling steps and more to do with data curation and data cleaning.","23_1_1_1_2"

On the other hand, Id say Piccolo got it right about all of it. However, and proportionally speaking, I believe we are facing a much of a market saturation in the Data field as well; but nothing absolutely crazy as every single job posting having +400 applicants. 

Compensation speaking, American and Europeans companies come here looking for young and cheap human talent. The job offer I declined was about 6.600 dollars/year, which I know is inhumane considering NA and EU salaries, but for a junior role here its relatively tempting. Its technically a low salary, but nothing too crazy to at least not give it some thought as a junior.

Experience wise, and with the exception of those two job offers, all employers were requesting 2-3 YOE after graduation at minimum. Sadly, Junior market is also non existing here.

Compensation wise& Id say its an interesting topic to talk about.

Tech and remote work has broadened the competitive field.

This is how the cookie crumbles. 

I don't care if you went to Harvard, I care if you do good work. Most Americans want to spend 80% of their time sending emails, complain about being overworked, and make 180k + equity.

- most business-side people can barely work with excel. Doubt they are capable of doing actual statistics, formulas and transformations, even in-tool. For now, even the most basic dashboarding roles are not automatable.

Data Science is usually a statistician or actuary with some level of domain expertise that does modeling (and knows how to do hypothesis testing) and analysis of data in that domain. While they should be proficient in a language like R or Python, anything else is good too as long as its not just Excel formulas.

Data Engineer should be someone with a software engineering background that has specific knowledge in setting up data processing pipelines, knows SQL and can develop data objects (even if youre largely working on unstructured data in a data lake), is proficient in at least a couple languages, and is largely knowledgeable on distributed processing techniques and solutions.

What IS true is that a fair amount of DS work overlaps with DE, and being good at DE makes you a better, more well-rounded DS (and arguably, having some quantitative analysis background can make you a better DE, too).

There is also a subset of common problems that both DEs and DSs can solve, mostly involving the surfacing of insights and basic descriptive analysis. Many DEs (like myself) have some DS background or were an analyst at some point. So for a subset of problems, you can solve them without hiring a data scientist.

So my score is that the presentation is over the top, but that there's a nugget of truth about the overlap between data science and data engineering.

As for why, well, there's a lot to that. A few blog posts that have resonated with me.

https://ryxcommar.com/2022/11/27/goodbye-data-science/

&gt; It seems like the main career growth data scientists subject themselves to is learning the API of some gradient boosting tool or consuming superficial + shallow + irrelevant knowledge. I dont really sympathize with this learning trajectory because Ive never felt the main bottleneck to my work was that I needed some gradient boosting tool. Rather the main bottlenecks Ive faced were always crappy infrastructure and lacking (quality) data, so it has always felt natural to focus my efforts toward learning that stuff to unblock myself.

https://shakoist.substack.com/p/why-business-data-science-irritates

&gt; Scientists come in wanting to build cutting edge models, and most of the time we have to crush their dreams, and tell them to start by solving the problem with SQL, and if absolutely necessary, a linear regression. If we do end up using more complex ML, the hard part is going to be constructing the surrounding software system, and the actual model implementation will be a by-the-book approach, and constitutes 2-5% of our codebase by lines.

&gt; The smartest staff scientist I ever worked with once told me My job is to tell junior scientists their ideas are bad, but they should feel good about them. And to tell senior leadership their ideas are bad, and they should feel bad about them. This is career progression in industry data science.

Basically, my career has been about solving problems. That's what I enjoy doing. The reality has increasingly been that the problems that need solved are infrastructure, not math; in fact, most of the problem is engineering, with a small core of math in the center. The industry is trending in such a way that the job of a ""Data Scientist"" is a small, narrow, isolated role that in many companies adds little value relative to the effort that is put in. Endlessly tuning a model that you run in Jupyter and feed shit is what passes for data science in some places, and my personality is such that I can't simply put my head down and work when things are so obviously badly designed. I will do that if I have no choice, but at this career step I have the choices.

This isn't universal, of course. The large tech companies have the actual infrastructure where the people tuning the models have good data and good infrastructure. If you enjoy doing that model tuning and you're in that place, you can do that narrow job more productively. You're still subject to the more foundational philosophy of science issues discussed in the posts, but you're at least not obviously engaging in nonsense.

But I've worked at one place that had the infrastructure and tooling I'm describing in my 13+ year career. I'm pretty sure something like 90% of companies ""doing data science"" don't have the right tooling and data to be successful at it. I've worked places where a few months in I told my boss ""you shouldn't have hired five data scientists, you should have hired five data engineers because the data and infrastructure is a trash fire"". Then I spent most of my time there doing engineering work.

So yeah. I like solving problems and in practice, as a data scientist, my ability to solve problems has been based on my ability to do engineering work. Every job I've had over the past few years has increasingly focused on doing engineering (at one point I was basically just a tech lead for a backend engineering team, even though I was a Principal Data Scientist). I enjoy engineering and I enjoy making tangible progress toward solving problems. Combine all that together and moving to Data Engineer from Data Scientist is a logical flow.","10_1_1"

""If you are a Data Scientist and you're not consistently spending time learning about how business operates, then prepare to be replaced by a data engineer"".

This is what I interpret: if you consider yourself to be a modeling purist, someone who thrives on just getting datasets and building the best model for that dataset and objective regardless of what the data represents, your job future is at risk because that is by far the most likely aspect of data science that will be automated.

And that is all true. With very few exceptions (really cutting edge models), the part of the process where you take a clean, well-defined dataset with a well-defined target variable and do cool modeling tricks to get the best model out of the deal - that is the least valuable and most replaceable part of a data scientists job.

The hardest part to replace is the part where you take a business process, you identify an opportunity to improve it, you abstract it into a mathematical representations, and get the data that represents it. That is the skillset that people who are good at math tend to excel at, and that people who are bad at math - no matter how much AutoML, GenAI, etc. you arm them with - will always be bad at. 

Someone who is bad at math can probably be taught how to train and deploy an ML model today. There are enough tools that if you want to put the effort to make it really easy, you can make it *really* easy.","43"

This post does a great job of explaining why normalization (general not batch) works. Though, I still feel the justification for batch normalization is very weak. I think there is a risk in creating a false sense of understanding, as it causes people to stop asking the question 'why'. 'Adding noise for a regularization effect' doesn't give an indication for why batchnorm would be preferred over the other countless ways of randomly perturbing the data. 

Here is a 2018 Nuerips paper showing that batch norm does not actually reduce CVS: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11604. Batch Norm is a great case study of something empirically working in certain settings (not RL for instance) and then having people try to retroactively come up with theoretical justifications. When these theoretical justifications are wrong, there is little pressure to correct them because the true justification is empirically based.

From another paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9238401: ""Despite the success of batch normalization (BatchNorm) and a plethora of its variants, the exact reasons for its success are still shady.""","4"

I had all of these and safe to say, 90% of my fellow students just passed the test but they don't really ""know"" the math. There's a big difference between learning it in a way you can use practically, and learning it to pass an exam. I only started to really learn it intuitively once I finished school and started to self-study with intention, in a deeper way.

I think focusing on the math for long-term satisfaction would only deliver the best ROI if you like the math to begin with.

I personally found it focusing on the business problem has provided much greater ROI and long-term satisfaction.

The reason for me is fairly simple. The business problem drives everything else and if you aren't solving the business problem then you are providing value to your employer/customer. Focusing only on the math or primarily on the math leads to people developing beautiful and elegant models that provide solutions to problems that don't exist or aren't important.

I think that mentality stems from the academic world where you can spend your career studying a particular segment of your field, regardless of whether it provides some quantifiable value to someone. And that is really important. A lot of major discoveries came from people studying areas that were thought to be dead ends.

However, just because that can be a worthwhile endeavor for some we shouldn't dismiss the value of focusing on solving problems that actually exist and are important to people/organizations.  I get a high from seeing the impact of what I do.","13"

Understanding fundamentals has helped me in more ways than I could imagine. At my last job, there was a PhD on the team and he was a PhD to the truest embodiment of one -- loved research, pondering questions, experimenting with new solutions and deriving results. One time I was working on a project with a bunch of different models, one of which was a logistic regression. I was performing probability calibration on all the models and he noticed I applied to the logistics regression as well. He went on to explain how that was not necessary since scores from a logistics regression model are already calibrated by design. He knew my background was in math and so he sat down and whiteboarded a derivation to show just that. It was quite eyeopening to be honest, and I think thats the most important part about math -- its a language. And knowing the language at a deeper level will let you 'communicate' and comprehend better all round.   


Recently I was applying for another job and there were some techniques I was unfamiliar with that fell under the umbrella of techs I could use on the job. After some research I had a superficial understanding but didnt know WHY it worked. I later found two foundational papers for developing the methodology -- both linear algebra heavy... and having that math background at least let me chew away at trying to understand what was going on. After a couple read throughs I think I had a decent understanding.

Is Maths important for Data Science? Yes, unquestionably. Is it the only thing that's important? Absolutely not.

If you're relatively weak in Maths, as a Data Scientist, studying up on some of the fundamentals is probably good ""ROI"" in terms of use of your time vs increasing your value as a DS. But beyond a certain point, that ROI will tail off steeply unless you're aiming for a very niche, Maths-heavy domain.

At some point, for example, in many cases it's not going to matter much if you can proof out all the Maths of the Adagrad optimizer on a white board if you can't write production standard code or create unit tests.

It's rare to simultaneously excel as a data scientist and as a manager because they're very different skill sets. When it comes to data skills, you either ""use it or lose it.""

But I spend about 30% of my hours in meetings and another 20% just on emails. Team management takes up another 10-20%, depending on the week. So really only 30-40% of my time is spent on contributing to deliverables, some of which are more strategic planning than actual reports.

I contribute most at the beginning of the project (research design) and then at the end (write-up findings). In a lot of ways, those are really the two most important stages of a project because that's where the stakeholder interfaces with the project: defining the problem correctly as understood by the stakeholder and choosing the right methodology, and then communicating findings effectively.

I trust my team with the intermediate steps: cleaning/wrangling data, executing on the research plan, etc. If I'm in the code, it's because of a QA concern or perhaps the team member is learning a new methodology. 

In terms of how to protect time, I just block time off on my calendar to dedicate to deliverables and limit meetings to 30% of my week. Most of the time if you tell someone that you're unavailable for the next two weeks for a meeting, they'll figure out how to get your feedback via emails. If something important and urgent comes up (see below), then I'll cancel or reschedule. 

Speaking of emails, you have to triage them as they come in and delay/ignore everything you can possibly get away with not responding immediately. I use something called the Eisenhower matrix: 2x2 with importance and urgency to categorize things. Many emails are urgent, but not important. Intentionally delay your response to those and you'll get fewer of them in the future because no one is going to ask you questions that require a one hour turnaround if they don't expect an answer for two days. Obviously you can't do that with every urgent email (some are actually important), but you can train people to be more self-reliant by delaying responses to questions that they can answer with a little more effort. 

It's obviously important to have the support of your manager with this sort of time management strategy and you don't want to have stuff escalated to them because you're always non-responsive. So part of the calculus is figuring out whether the person sending you a dumb question via email is likely to escalate an untimely response to their manager. If not, then it's not important to them either. And if it is escalated and the head of our division gets involved, I can say ""my response was delayed because I was working on X and I perceived X to be more important."" Nearly all of the time, they'll agree with my assessment. 

I still spend 20% of my work time on emails, but I could literally spend 50%+ of my week on those if I didn't filter the unimportant stuff. 

There are two skills that are essential to being a successful data science manager:

1. Defining the minimally viable product; and
2. Distinguishing between importance and urgency. 

It's impossible to be successful in this sort of role without doing both of those well.","4_2_1"

1. Understanding stakeholder needs to frame the research question(s)
2. Deciding what combination of descriptive, correlational, causal, and/or predictive analyses are needed
3. Defining the minimally viable product as well as opportunities to exceed the MVP if time allows
4. Establishing a project plan that fully scopes and sequences the tasks necessary to produce a successful set of deliverables, including list of milestones with timeline
5. Identifying the best available data source(s)
6. Choosing the appropriate empirical strategy in order to answer the research question(s)

I've been delegating an increasing share of project management tasks to a team member who is interested in project management and I'm happy to have her do that. Project management activities are mostly what are described in (3). 

The hardest part is often stakeholder engagement because non-researchers often struggle with coming up with good empirical questions for which adequate data is available to answer. The second hardest is choosing the correct methodology. Defining the MVP as early as possible is critical because that drives the project plan.   

Since we're talking management of projects, I group our work into four general buckets:

* Major deliverable (high effort, high impact)
* Minor deliverable (low effort, high impact)
* Supplemental Analyses (low effort, low impact)
* Money Pits (high effort, low impact)

We try to allocate as much time towards major and minor deliverables (i.e., high impact), but supplemental analyses are inevitable. Usually these come to us as ad hoc requests. I try to fight against money pits. 

For a major deliverable, you want to invest a lot into the research design and get explicit approval on the research plan (usually 6-8  paragraphs). Minor deliverables are generally straightforward analyses, but they should still have approval from leadership (2-3 paragraphs).

I generally don't bother with putting much time into research design for supplemental analyses, since by definition they're low effort. I do put effort into research designs for money pits, because often I need to present to leadership exactly why I believe the project requires a lot of effort and why it will be low impact. Sometimes its possible through iterative conversations with the stakeholder to reframe their initial act from a money pit to a major/minor deliverable.","4_2_1_1_1"

Being in the room when those decisions are made can help you give your team projects they can actually execute and produce results that the organization might actually use.

In my case every day feels like I'm mired in red tape and meetings and saying the same things to the same people over and over again.

1. Projects can start with up to 2-3 weeks of preliminary work. special cases can be on a team member's back burner for months on and off, as long as its under my radar. but actual work hours will be capped at \~2 weeks.

2. any medium / heavy project will be AB-tested as soon as possible, same as any other PM initiative. projects that cannot be initiated by preliminary experiment stay on the sketch board.

3. preliminary testing will be the most ugly, manually defined, sketchily set up experiments, and with the most straightforward KPI markers for win/lose conditions. they will always touch a main business KPI, or some very important aspect in our product.

4. preliminary work will be done quietly and with minimal exposure (including first 1-2 experiments). no higher-ups in the loop before we have potential impact numbers, backed by experiment.

5. Test was successful = business impact is both plausible and **noticeable**. improving internal metrics by 0.6% ""significantly"" means nothing; getting a maybe-random +1% in Users or Revenue is king.

6. after a dumb initial experiment, we 0) investigate the Prod data (users or systems with the manipulation) 1) flesh out a real experiment 2) flesh the data work we will have to do to sustain that experiment 3) how we expect the project to scale.

7. after describing 6.3 --&gt; we flesh out, plan, create, and embedd the Data Infra to support the project. all the way through as much as possible.

that's usually the point where R&amp;D and Product teams are introduced, and everything goes haywire. the project will prevail if you get at least a Director or VP to bet on it, otherwise it will be an uphill battle all the way and super heavy time weight.

I had managed to release 4 successful DS projects via these steps, and avoided / got to early shut down of 5 or 6 projects handed down by management. we have also failed about 10 suggested projects, but my team members now know that when they pin down a success, it has a fair shot at getting to Prod.","12"

Those who believe that they should only work on **things that have predictable, preferrably short-term value,** and then there are companies who believe a sizable portion of their budget should be dedicated to **research and development**.

The former? That is most companies. These companies want to work on projects that allow you to say ""if we do this, we will grow revenue by x% over the next couple of years"". They do not want to say ""hey, if we do this maybe it won't work, but if it does it will be cool"". 

Structurally, you cannot change them. You're not going to come in and carve out time to advocate for innovative stuff because they want you to use 100% of your time on delivering known value.

If you want to advocate for innovation, you need to work at a company that cares about innovation.

&gt;Initially, I thought the barrier was a lack of vision among decision-makers

This may be partly right because of self-selection - i.e., the people who end up at leaderhsip roles at companies that don't care about R&amp;D are not going to be R&amp;D-strong people. But that's the nature of the relationship - it's not that they're fundamentally incapable of it, it's that their job's primary concern is not that.","16"

I for example use tools similar to MLFlow. So in this case it will just upload the image file to S3 and I use the web UI to view the metrics, visualizations, model artifacts etc. It's all automated... I don't remember the last time I had to think about visualization.

Once you get into that mindset that you don't have a ""remote machine"" then developing with ephemeral spark clusters, kubernetes pods, serverless solutions, custom hardware etc. becomes easy. I can work with basically anything with my current setup.","7_1_1_1_1"

I've never felt compelled to use jupyter notebooks ever. They seem way too complicated to justify the overhead of a weird file format that requires yet another program to view and edit. I suppose I can see the appeal of seeing plots inline, but Rmarkdown can also do that. Furthermore, most of the things I need to run are just heavy enough that I need to wait several minutes anyways, so having instantaneous feedback for a plot/other output isn't all that helpful.

With emacs, I just open a repl next to whatever file I'm editing and copy over bits of code to test as needed. No jupyter notebook needed.

The other advantage of using emacs (although not exclusively an emacs thing) is that you need to set up everything yourself. This takes time obviously, but this forces you to actually learn the tools, which in my experience has served me well.","37"

-you can pivot a single record vertically, making it way easier to see all the values and long column names
-other things I'm not thinking of currently

Sublime Text for manipulations, especially dealing with lots of columns at once or regex find/replace. Multiline edit helps me wrap every column in an if/coalesce/convert. The arithmetic operator makes it easy to convert column to column1-column25, etc","47"

The form is pretty bad, with unnecessary and redundant questions, and some fields which hold 10- 100 separate pieces of information in one cell that I need to extract. The form also has branching based on the type of entry, which translates into lots of half-empty rows in Excel that take up a lot of space and make for a lot of unnecessary time spent scrolling. Certain rows then need to be looked over by certain people and returned to me, and these people require separate Excel files for their rows. But then everything needs to be gathered into the same place for record. If this sounds tedious, it takes 10x as long as you imagine. Just fixing all the rows and getting this stupid thing readable into 9 different files for 9 different people takes me a whole afternoon.

Enter: Finding out I can get Python without admin credentials from the Microsoft store. Not so with any fancy IDE. I put in a software request with IT, but in the meantime 

I wrote a whole Python module and a script that wrangles the Excel file into two separate, neat dataframes (one for each branch/entry type), extracts the data from the cells with multiple data points, adds the relevant columns based on the existing ones, and then writes separate Excel files for each appropriate person&. in Notepad.

Not that I would say Notepad is my preferred IDE, but at the moment, it is literally the text editor that I use to work with data at my job.","75"

In fact, forget about the titles being so domain-specific, but the majority of senior roles (i.e. roles requiring 2+ years of experience) are already domain specific even if they still share a common title.

Some competency is necessary but thats too much to expect from a person. One person simply cannot understand everything and be an expert in both. 

Like ds is like software engineering. Software engineers are by no means SME financial analysts in banks who only know how to work with excel files.  I work in a mature company and it is not data scientist to be SME but just understand the business and product. 

But to be fair its more of that type of work you do. If you need to be a heavy sme then most likely you are a business/data analyst not a data scientist. I havent seen a single job require a bachelors/certificate in a field but completely gloss over the actual technical thungs. At best, this is a nice to have not the main differentiator of the job. Anyone can learn the business in their first year on the job. Else there is no possible way to change industries.

Edit: but i need you to explain to
me whats the difference between a data scientist and the financial analyst looking at a data scientist. Same thing with a doctor vs the data scientist in healthcare. Like do you mean sme = understanding the data and being able to tell a story vs sme = being a fully fledged analyst/doctor before being considered qualified to do the job. This distinction can literally disqualify 90% of people who actually work as unqualified because a masters in data science is completely useless then.

I know business analysts is a sub field of analytics and there is a lot of business interaction while others focus more on just less business work. Still important but it isnt the main driver of the job. 


I am genuinely asking what makes job posting now focused on business domain knowledge, because if it gets too specialized alot of us will not be equipped to do the job. What about software developers isnt data science more tech driven than heavy statistics. Like I genuinely trying to understand because if business knowledge is a hard requirement then how the world will someone get a entry level job in the first place? 

From my experience it depends on how close you are to the business. Some data scientists work very closely with the business while others are more analytics and results focused. Your responsibility is to build model, solve problems, and optimize everything. While the end goal is focused on the business rules that is all. 

What about a domain agnostic thing like software engineering. Like data science has more with software  than actuaries/statisticians. 

For example with my personal exposure 
i found the worst data scientist to be the business heavy and not SWE heavy because any work done is basically incomplete work or code that pretty much is wrong with errors on everything. A good SWE can be more useful since any product can actually be functional beyond regression model = x and this alligned with business narrative therefore we should do Y.  However the actual model in production does not have any way to actual observe the results in the real world or how the model is actually behaving beyond the test set cross validation in development.

So to my main point, like yes business is important for the function but that is the part where you learn the job. Business knowledge is something you develop over time in the role but the core skills is what gets you the job. I wouldnt deny that i need to use business knowledge in my job and that it is different than other roles, however a strong exposure to the basics is 10x more important than any business knowledge else we will be paying lip service to the business with nothing we actually do.","8_1_1_1_1"

The business analyst is actually a really good example of a split off from the original. Data analysis is a split off from business analysis. They were so different and required so much additional knowledge/training that it developed into a whole new field, therefore they would thereafter be differentiated from business analysts.

Im asking when you think data scientists will have similar break offs. When will a school look at a data science curriculum and say wow; there are a lot of (INSERT SUBJECT HERE)-specific models, tools, or analysis methods.  I dont think a typical data science curriculum is sufficient to fill out these needs for this profession. We need to rework or augment heavily the curriculum to fulfill this need? 
I mean let me bring up an example I havent done yet. Financial engineering is a specialization that basically requires its own masters degree right now. It utilizes a lot of data science concepts but has finance industry specific information, both technical and non-technical. When will data science be filled with all of these separated-out-fields?

Data science is a holistic field and if analytics professionals are phased out then I can guarantee that any consulting firm is out as many of its consultants work in different industries.

Also analytics itself is the same thing and generally the same tools, just the type of model is different. For example lets take a specific industry, if you work in 3 different companies in the same field each company would do the work differently. If we were to build a model the features can be a little different as these are the business secrets but the underlying model is the same. 

I mean correct me if i am wrong but what type of classification are you building that is sooo different from the entire industry? 9/10 i am confident its either a regression or a tree based model. 

Data science is a tool, the industry and business knowledge is something you learn in the field. And no matter what school teaches it will not match the industry in terms of business: thats why the new grad financial engineer knows nothing despite having the business degree.  I highly doubt that data science will be phased out anytime soon. I work in the job and I by no means am bounded by the type of models but even then that isnt as huge of a deal breaker. Specializing in an industry is always going to be a plus but it is not the type of thing where we will see 20 masters of analytics in every single industry out there. I by no means think that someone who might work in telcom, or healthcare is going to be completely useless in my field despite our jobs being different in the details.

We both can interpret  a model convergence, probability, and auc etc& so how bad can it be? What is so different? I mean we all at some point started our careers as freshers, because i am confident everyone is by some point new to an industry. 

Are you like writing a programming language that we never heard of? Are you like fetching queries differently?

It was rather silly, after all 99% of scientific discovery that is statistically grounded is based on p values, and it is a reasonable method that has created tremendous value.   But I had some exposure to Bayesian, I actually had a business case that was Bayes Theorem when I was hired, so I knew there was a different approach and I was willing to suspend judgement.  He worked on a central credit risk management group and he pitched a big project to re-do our customer level valuation models using a Bayesian framework that would allow us to learn faster as credit performance changed.  

I got called in to assist when it was clear the guy could not pull it off.  By then it was too late he had over promised and he couldnt get the damn thing to converge. This was circa 2008, we had plenty of computational power, and it was big data but not massive compared to what I have been working with lately.  

I dont recall any of the specifics of his methods, other than in retrospect it was truly overkill.  Priors really are not adding a lot of value when you already know your curve shapes and levels and all the details of valuations. The world is not changing so fast that Bayesian is going to give you an advantage, and even if it did you would still have to convince senior leadership to follow a new path when the current method is trusted and very robust.  It was a lot of Bayesian blowhard for show.  

He was out within 15 months, and he had a good gig at GOOG until he was outed as a serial sexual predator.  I dont ascribe that to his Harvard credentials or they he was a Bayesian elitist, but Im open to testing the priors. 

Truly, I am waiting for the clear example of where Bayesian methods clearly lead to better decisions in a real world setting, where the degree of improvement justifies the added complexity management.  I dont doubt that there are examples, but Ive not seen the proofs in the field, which is why I say Beware of Bayesians bearing gifts.  I dont deny that it works.

The whole purpose of a prior is to regularize or shrink the possible mass of the parameter over some region of the parameter space.

There are some decision-making problems where a proper understanding of uncertainty is key. I am thinking about forecasting problems where you need to ensure a given service level... e.g. stock management and demand forecasting.  
If you size your delivery platform to be able to deal with the mean level of clients you will be wrong (in case your number of clients follows a symmetric distribution) 50 percent of the time. You may want to provide an higher quantile of the distribution (say the 95th) so to increase the level of service.  
Providing that number (or something that looks like that number) can be done in several ways, among which bayesian methods (but there is also quantile regressions, conformal prediction, parametric prediction intervals and the like).  
What really shows that OP is a kid fresh out of uni (or an old and grumpy academic) is this fetishism for methodology.

""out there"" nobody gives a flying f\*\*k about what method you use. For what is worth you could ask the numbers to your mum...

What they care about is that they are right, reliable, and impacting the business","32"

As a programmer, I like to build things. I like to write code that solves some problem, ideally in a performant and elegant way. I like to think about the different ways I can solve a problem. And the pros and cons of different approaches. 

I also like being able to think about and anticipate bugs, which results in higher quality code. And when I do find bugs, and fix bugs, I like writing tests against those bugs. And I like knowing that if those bugs ever pop up again, they will be easy to find and fix.

With dataframes, a lot of the complexity is abstracted away. And code related to using dataframes is not particularly challenging or intellectually stimulating imo. And that's great for what it's designed to do: get out of people's way and help them conduct analysis.","8"

Serious answer: I cant speak for everyone trying to get into the field, but for myself I got into it because engineering/programming alone doesn't scratch my curiosity itch.

I worked in web engineering for 5 years and hated it. It was boring drudgery with basically no intellectual stimulation. If I were in data engineering I would probably hate it. MLE?

""If I'm 100% honest my interest in Data Science doesn't come from the traditional 'Data Science' part.

To my knowledge they're different disciplines, but require a somewhat similar skillset. Though I'm probably a bit off the mark.

That said, I'm not married to the idea other than as a general direction to point my tech career in and plans will probably change as I become more informed of what data and data related jobs actually entail. As opposed to the over-inflated 'Join our course and be a data scientist in 8 months!' stuff people with something to sell me try to push.

Most of what you're doing as a software engineer is not really tackling ""hard problems"" in the same way. 

A software engineer will be tasked with building an ""app"" with X,Y,Z interface that offers U,V,X features with T latency. But the vast vast majority of the time, there is not really any concern about where it is doable or how doable it is. Its mostly a question of how long it will take you and how reliable it will be, etc.

But data science on the other hand, is usually focused on really difficult problems that literally nobody knows how to solve and we don't even know if it is solvable. Or even if it is solvable, how solvable will it be and how close can we get to our desired outcomes? This makes data science work a lot more gratifying for me personally over typical software engineering work. 

One last thing, but data science also has the benefit of blending business with software and statistics. Software engineers don't have the same focus or involvement on the core business and value propositions in the same way. Depends what you prefer best, software engineering is great for problem solving and building though.","20"

At the university as a marketing major I felt in love with marketing research and statistics. And despite the fact that later I have been working in business for 15 years (as a strategy developer at a huge corporation), this love has never faded away.

And finally at the age of 45 I started to miss my web developer days and that I create things.

And, in parallel, I advice my kids to study economics and data science, too.

If I could restart my life, I would start with a mathematics and social sciences double major, and then I would do an msc in statistics. This is such a beautiful and complex field, that I fell in love with it each and every day again and again.","47"

So basically had ahead good possibilities for a career in data science.   
I ended up pursuing a career in Data Engineering.

There were many reasons that led me down this road:

1) The first one that I encountered is that since there is a lot of demand but not that much offer for Data Science jobs (at least in my country), the entry level positions don't have a lot of benefits and the salaries are kinda low (in general a decent position in this field gets over 200 CVs sent on Linkedin)

2) Second one: most of the industrial technologies and projects are really similar to eachother. In industrial applications (where the gaussian peak of the jobs offer lies) there is not a lot of room to experiment with new algorithms or methods and seldom everything reduces to implement GBMs or NNs (Which could be cool, but it was something I was not that attracted to)

3) On the opposite, Data Engineering Jobs are far more available (less appealing, especially after university), and since there are less applicants salaries tends to be higher and jobs are more accessible (had a couple of colleagues who did not even have a technical degree).

4) Being a Data Engineer these days allow you to learn also a lot of cloud technologies, a lot more to learn, that gives depth to the job. Those skills are expendable in a lot of roles, so if you plan to change role in a future that is easily on the board.

That's more or less what led me to abandon Data Science, nowadays I can say i'm quite happy with my career.","68"

A real-world example: We create a performance table (my domain is finance) that, if allowed to, would grow to tens of trillions of rows. Simply a matter of creating enough scenarios that are allowed to map many-to-many when it comes to measurement periods (i.e., start on Jan 1st., stop at Jan 2nd, and stop at Jan 3rd. etc., with different calculations for each).

You will almost always pick a couple partitions to pull data from. So, while the ""core table"" is huge, the workspace remains easy to manage.","2"

I was at Amazon for a bit where there were daily order datasets that were in the billions, so if you have a few years worth of that a trillion isn't so crazy. If you're looking for an average, you probably could do a sample. If you're looking for ""total revenue"" usually you just sum the revenue column. 

Obviously it's not the same as just summing a column in Excel since you need to know about partitioning schemes and whatnot - I.e. how using a columnar format like parquet can lessen the memory load if you just need to sum one column such as revenue. 

When I was in grad school I remember we had a project that had like 20k records and people were like ""omg this is crazy"". I was at Amazon at the time and almost laughed at that. 

But the ""trillion row"" requirement really is just a weed-out. I think data jobs fall into the following categories:

1.) Working with 50k-1 Million rows: Excel user
2.) 1 million - 10 million rows: Pandas user
3.) 10 mill-100 mill: Polars or some other fancy python

I worked in the business side of an insurance company doing underwriting and claims and then went back to grad school. Wrote what must have been one heck of an admissions essay. All I remember is that my Mom said it was overdone and I should reconsider. Its literally the only criticism my Mom has made of my writing (no hard feelings, just stands out). 

When I got to grad school I realized that I had taken 2 math courses in the past 7 years and failed one of them (pre-calculus). So I took a totally different approach. I rewrote every variable, equation and notation into actual words, like a sentence. It totally changed how I saw math and dovetailed nicely with learning to program. 

Did really well in the program, finished very quickly and then did the consulting firm thing. Went back into insurance on the data side and its worked out well so far.

A problem I think every data person struggles with is answering the question ""so what?"". My boss loves to ask this question and it helps keep us focused. The ""So What"" should always be how does this data or insight make us better, faster, smarter, and more money. Answering these questions will ensure you are working towards meaningful insights.

I find a lot of data people(myself included) get caught up in the cool factor or really technical parts of what you're working on. Oh, you made a really accurate regression? So what? You made a random Forrest to model something? It's cool, but so what? The so what may be, this regression helps us move forward with confidence that price is actually a driving factor on product A, but not on product B, so we can price product B higher and make more margin. The random forest may help us understand customer behavior much better so we know how to better bundle offers or maybe you made a KNN and graphed it really cool but the so what is better customer segmentation so we know who we are targeting with what products. 

The list is endless, but the thought exercise is invaluable. Learning this will be more helpful than any youtube course specifically. Results may vary but I have found that YT and online course are often great for learning how to do something but unless you find one specifically tailored to your industry, they aren't great for understanding why you should do something. That Why is your true north and guide on any professional project. It will come with experience. Absolutely make use of online resources but always be thinking back to how you can relate the lessons learned to your use cases. 

If you want to learn how:

Stat Quest is great for understanding complex concepts and statistics.

R Programming 101 is great for learning the basics of R.

Guy in a Cube and Enterprise DNA are great for learning Power BI.

Leila Gharani is great for learning Excel and MS Office stuff for general productivity in office tools your non technical stakeholders will be using. 

All of those are on YouTube and I have found to be helpful. Also, find people and communities on linked in and there are frequent online meetups with working professionals talking through how they do stuff during a lunch and learn style presentation and many are free.

I hope this helps!","3_1_1"

I dont think there is antying wrong with using notebooks, often times they are great. But calling it 'industry standard' is just flat out ridiculous. 

Your IDE/Development method should be selected with your end goal in mind. Are you deploying/pushing this code to prod (or handing it off to an MLE)? Then skip the notebook and used a fully fledged IDE, code with deployment/production in mind. 

Doing a quick exploratory analysis, data munging, etc... then yea, a notebook is visual and ideal.

For reference, I oversee a number of data science teams at a large company, I would say that ~70% of work is in a traditional IDE of the individuals choice (VS, Spyder) the other 30% is notebooks. The exception is if using Databricks natively, which tends to be notebooks.","1_5_2"

You can write .py files and call them from your notebook, you know?

But I also feel like you're making a bigger deal than it actually is. 

There are 2 main 'issues' with anaconda as you alluded to.

1) Using Conda instead of pip, and thus not (natively) using PyPi. Conda isnt the issue, its just a package manager like any other (even with some perks over pip), but the issue is 'do you trust Anaconda inc to manage your packages'? As far as I'm concerned, there is no reason not to, but Anaconda is still a commercial entity at the end of the day, and we all feel some kind of way about that. You can always coerce conda to use PyPi should you feel its an issue.

2) Anaconda comes with preinstalled packages. If these are useful to you then it can be seen as a plus, if not it can be seen as bloatware. 

Anaconda does bring some other features to the table, but again, personal preference there. 

As far as I see its like Debian and Ubuntu - they're the same underpinnings, Ubuntu is great for many people, takes a lot of the setup work out of the equation, but also comes with the bloatware and SNAP, over Debian and APT. 

For transparency, I do not use Anaconda/Conda (and Ubuntu is not my distro of choice).","7_1_1_1_1"

For specific types of workflows, Anaconda (or Miniconda, or Mamba) can be much more powerful and easy to manage than pip environments. Just off the top of my head:

* Conda environments hardlinks packages so as to avoid duplication. Install pytorch across 5 different virtualenv enviroments and let me know what happens to your disk space.
* Conda supports non-Python dependencies. This is a big one specifically for packages that require binary dependencies. A super famous one is [GDAL](https://gdal.org/api/python_bindings.html) Python bindings. In conda, all-batteries are included, but the pip package is lame duck: it requires the user to have Python headers and the GDAL library installed separately. Some libraries get around it by prepackaging their binaries in the pip package (looking at you psycopg2-binary) which bloats the install and is not meant to be used for production systems.
* Numpy links with MKL BLAS using conda but OpenBLAS in pip. MKL BLAS is significantly faster on intel CPUs. Yes, pypi has intel-numpy available, but its not as stable as just using conda numpy.
* You can install any pip package with conda, but not any conda package with pip
* You can install miniconda/mamba in containers very easily. Ans since everything is self-contained, [you can often nuke a bunch of stuff that you don't need to keep the sizes down](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/conda-docker-image-size/).","7_1_1_1_2_1"

Anaconda is a massive and bloated distribution of data sci stuff that ships with Spyder, which is why I mentioned it. Conda is an alternative package manager to pip/venv. Lots of people getting started in data science get stuck with Anaconda because it usually works out of the box, with a GUI launcher and 3gb of stuff. Then I said pip/venv are preferable to Anaconda, which I think is true.

Then you wrote this nice post about how Conda can have advantages over pip/venv and called me rude and condescending. Do you see how your post transitioned from Anaconda (a software distribution) to Conda (an open source package/environment manager) without acknowledging they're not the same thing?

on top of that, when it comes time to move your model to production or put it in any sort of service pipeline, converting from notebooks to .py is an additional task which is costly and time consuming - might as well have it done from the start.

my favourite way to do this is to create functions, classes in notebooks, test them and visualize the results, troubleshoot, etc, and then immediately store them in .py files

if they are needed again in notebooks, I import the class directly instead of defining everything there.

At the start, the details are all hypothetical and untested. You, a data scientist, have a hunch that you can solve the problem. You suspect you can use a give bundle of features and a given bundle of preprocessing steps and your favorite ML algorithm. You're pretty sure you have a good training set and good labels. But you also know at least one of those assumptions is probably wrong in some stupid way, and you're going to have to modify something. Possibly everything. You know that you might not simply have to try a bunch of things; you might have to try a bunch of combinations of things. The potential search space at this stage is very large, and no matter how much of a badass DS you may be, it might take a lot of iterations before you find a methodology that works. At this stage of the process, you need to optimize for writability. You need to be able to spend as little time coding and as much time testing as possible. You need to be able to spit out whatever graph or table or heatmap your heart desires as soon as you think of it. Notebooks are superb for this stage of development because they stay out of the way and let you bang rocks together without complaining about all the noise.

Congrats, you went through 100 iterations in a week thanks to your notebook; and now it's time to talk to engineers. Well... that's going to be a problem because your notebook is an absolute mess. You spent a week descending into the depths of hell, and everyone else looks at your notebook and sees incantations of a madman that mysteriously solve the problem. You need to take these incantations and translate them into code that's optimized for readability. This can either take the form of a new notebook or .py files, depending on the situation. But the end result is going to be something that is exceptionally linear, has lots of comments saying what you're trying to accomplish, and uses very plain implementations of things. If you did something complicated, it probably needs to go into a function of some sort, so the nastiness gets compartmentalized. This is where you take your mishmash of magic and turn it into a clearly defined pipeline. This is also the time where you go and start writing documentation on the solution's methodology.

At this point, it's time for software engineering. You have a solution that's presumably going into production. That means it's going to be a living artifact, taking stuff in, spitting stuff out... eventually drifting into the ditch if left unattended. At this stage, ""your"" code has to be optimized for maintainability. Someone, whether that's you, engineers, or ops, has to make sure the solution fits into production infrastructure and is easily modifiable. This means incorporating software engineering principles like encapsulation, separation of concerns, etc. You'll almost certainly need .py files for this (or Databricks notebooks instead of Jupyter notebooks) because someone is going to need to set up functions and classes and enums and configs and all that fancy crap that gives DS's headaches but keeps everyone else around them sane.

It's worth pointing out that, the more of this lifecycle you can handle on your own, the easier it'll be for everyone around you to jump in and work with you. You might not be responsible for all of it, but being capable of it will let you anticipate their needs, including the need to convert to .py files at some point. You'll also find that, by writing library code in .py files, you can start building your own personal suite of standard tools and significantly increase your productivity.","1_4_2"

They do exactly that, they have a git repo in the back, but it is a linear history, there is no branching or merging. 

Diff-ing commits on the same branch cause the same issue, you are absolutely right, this is circumvented by databricks by letting users work in the same notebook, so you (hopefully) never reach a point where you have diverging versions of the notebook. Though I had notebooks ""breaking"" when I was working with a colleague on the same notebook, when one of us had an unstable connection. By breaking I mean, that some changes were simply overwritten.
The reason I said no-branching is that merges and merge conflicts are much less likely.

&gt; If you're encountering merge conflicts or anything complicated then I agree with others that you're using notebooks wrong

I mean... any serious software project will have merging conflicts eventually? That's literally the reason why there is git. I'm curious what kind of projects you are working on when you never experienced any merge conflicts? The only setup in which I can imagine that, is if you always have personalized notebook, without people sharing them or have them shared via a tools like databricks, that simply overwrites potential merge conflicts by removing the conflicting section. On databricks though I see people copying notebooks constantly to work on different versions, leading to diverging code within the notebooks.

On databricks you will not encounter merging issues, but if you are unlucky the most recent changes will be overwritten without any notice, when two people work on the same notebook in the same cells, if the connection is bad.

You are correct: we are actively addressing some of these fundamental flawsreproducibility, maintainability, reusability, etc.

In Jupyter notebooks, the code you see doesn't necessarily match the outputs because (1) if. you delete a cell, its variables stay in memory,ls may still reference, and (2) users can execute cells in arbitrary order. This leads to widespread reproducibility issues. [One study](https://blog.jetbrains.com/datalore/2020/12/17/we-downloaded-10-000-000-jupyter-notebooks-from-github-this-is-what-we-learned/#consistency-of-notebooks) analyzed 1 million Jupyter notebooks and found that 36% didn't reproduce.

Because we have a deterministic execution order, we don't need to store the outputs (you still can if you want for side-effectful execution or sharing). This allows us to store these as .py files. This leads to smaller git diffs. Also, the .py files have no ""magic"" in them, so you can run them as python scripts.","13_1_1"

Started doing my analysis, deal scoring, win/loss analysis, etc. Kept telling them that clerical data issues were making things difficult but I powered through. Got clever with my logistic regression models (didnt want to use deep learning because model explainability was important). 

I ultimately told them that 80% of their pipeline was garbage and there were a few simple things they could do to improve their chances of closing deals. But that I also needed more time to incorporate new datasets like rep performance and firmographics. 

They ultimately didnt care and just wanted me to give them an end of quarter sales estimate. Keep in mind my main source of data was salesforce where reps constantly game the system to make it look like theyre successful. 

So, I extrapolated my win/loss analysis out to create an aggregate sales estimate. And I told them that we were on track to hit about 60% of the quota. They freaked out and wanted me to make it look better for the board presentation.

Wouldnt you know, end of quarter came and my prediction was off by about 2%.

What did they do? They told me to stop working on my model. lol

One influencer just disclosed that theyve passed $100k in LinkedIn sponsored posts. Not sure what the time period was. They have over 150k followers.

You can also make money as a LinkedIn instructor, you get a flat payment up front and then the more views your course gets, the more royalties you can earn. Having a lot of followers can help boost that. 

Also job leads. Another influencer who has over 100k followers was recently laid off and landed a new job within weeks and has said multiple times its because of their network.

Burla is...

* Incredibly expensive at $0.05 /cpu hour
* Quite limited to a specific workflow where I can map inputs to functions (eg data processing), can wait for it to finish and not worry about failures, don't have to worry about the data transfer to the cloud
* Offers no security or privacy guarantees that would allow me to run anything with personal data or data I need to protect for any reason.

You're essentially offering batch data processing for scientists at an incredibly high price. I can think of a few uses I may have had for it when I was a researcher but as a data scientist, I'm not sending my data to you without a data processing agreement in place in order to save myself the effort of setting up an AWS instance.","2"

Also, some additional context here. I tried to go live with a fully managed version, people loved the API but the service was too slow. I went heads down for 3 months to reduce latency so it is under a second. I'm going to be releasing the much quicker fully managed version and then an open source version for your own cloud (the open source version is 100% free)

1) regarding the fully managed version, Burla is 3-5x cheaper than current leaders in the cloud abstraction space... Modal, Coiled, and AnyScale. They are cost prohibitive and it impacts their distribution but a lot of people are willing to spend that kind of money because they don't have to deal with infra configuration and maintenance.  Our open source version is 100% free, you install it in your cloud and the only thing you pay is the standard AWS, GCP or Azure cost. 

2) right now we don't support inter-node communication (we will) but there are still a bunch of embarrassingly parallel workloads it supports really well. Batch Inference, Hyperparameter tuning, Compute and Image Embeddings, Web Scraping, Pre-Processing massive amounts of data, and Monte Carlo simulations. 

3) this is the exact point that made us go open source, we realized that distribution in the cloud abstraction space was really low because most institutional businesses require everything to be hosted in their own cloud. Those businesses are not allowed to use a fully managed service, many companies are risk averse like this. For small Silicon Valley companies they just care about engineering velocity and will use a bunch of managed services, obviously not the case for fortune 500 businesses. 

If you don't mind me asking when you need to leverage massive amount of compute what solutions do you currently use?","2_1"

Without Burla you'd typically need to build a compute cluster which is a group of interconnected virtual machines in the cloud. This is time consuming and requires a bunch of infrastructure engineering experience. 

There are other abstractions on the market that make it easier to interact with the cloud. The main issue is configuration is complex and the managed versions are extremely expensive and don't meet compliance rules at many organizations.","3_1"

I was in a similar position. Took a Sr. Data Analyst role after my MS and wasnt exposed to DS centric problems, but worked more on data pipelines, automations and internal tools development. I had a CS background and most of my work was driven by me researching the best tools for the job and using them where possible. (Eg. I shifted workflow management and scheduling from Knime to Airflow, wrote an internal GPT bot within a few weeks of llama release as a POC). 

This might not be possible in all circumstances - I was definitely lucky to be on a lean 2 people analytics/ automation team, so there was less red tape around approvals. This led me to develop a taste for software development. I applied for an SDE role internally, and got the job.

I have had times where I used R, Python, and SAS all in the same work day (I worked for a large organization that handled very diverse projects).

Different projects and use cases require different tools.

I typically used SAS for clinical trials and animal trial analysis, Python for NLP or really any kind of neural net... And R for most other things, lol.

My formal education is as a statistician so I was mostly taught to use R and SAS in school and really only use Python when working on projects that require it. I prefer R for data visualization and most other non ""deep learning"" projects.","2"

Python is a bit more of a multi-tool of a language. Definitely the go-to for NLP or any deep learning but I really hate data cleaning and data visualization in Python. It is just so much less elegant than R, imo. And the packages that are designed for more traditional statistical learning models tend to be a bit ""dumbed down"" compared to their counterparts in R... Like some statistician out there has released an R package for almost any niche technique you want to do.

I do think R and Python are converging in capabilities, though, especially as they continue to port over popular packages so that you can use them in the other language.","2_1_1_1"

Of course R is an open source and no one at facebook can stop you from using it if you insist, but there is no production support for it and eventually you'd need to translate whatever you did in R to something that is supported, like Python.

2. Timeline of deliverable

Typically, when a company says ""the project must all be delivered on day X in one go!"" and the project is non-trivial, the vision is suffering from a lack of design and requirements from the get-go and it forecasts a terrible experience! Every project can be broken down, subjected to QA, added to CI/CD, and so on. Stakeholders who think it can't thinks Excel is as handy as cloud infrastructure in all situations.

One major difference between sleep and the waking state is that in sleep your critical thinking is reduced to a rudiment, at best. It's all intuition, very little reasoning.

There are probably differences between people in this regard, but speaking in general do not expect your sleeping brain to deal well with analytic problems.

That being said, people can and do find solutions to complex problems in their sleep, but it's intuition-based. Just like many NN models out there. But for every good solution you find this way, you experience thousands of nonsensical dreams.

It always depends on the compromises youre allowed to make and what the goal is. If the data is so bad that you can barely get useful results out of it I dont even bother cleaning it carefully. Id rather focus on using it to develop a concept to analyze better data with and then suggest how to collect it better. Now obviously its not always that extremely bad, but Ive been there. Sometimes you gotta bring the tough news and tell the people in charge to collect better data before they get results. Its might make some people upset but at times thats simply the responsible thing to do. In this case things were so chaotic that they just accepted it, put the project on hold and I ended up leaving the company for unrelated reasons soon after. I heard its unclear if itll be continued at all but they simply stored my work and now somebody else might get to do it or it simply is forgotten. Not my problem anymore I guess.

The problem was the entire workplace was extremely cheap, so there was little experienced staff and those who were, were terribly underpaid and there was a severe lack of organization. I feel bad for the other people there. The analysts and programmers there were largely very sweet people but there were some really toxic people in especially the more business heavy parts of the company and middle to upper management but also some network engineers. Control freaks, severe gossip, cholerics, bullies, power abusers, snitches, passive aggressiveness, racism&Ive seen about anything except for physical violence and sexual harassment. And a family that owned the company that was basically acting like modern aristocrats with zero respect for their employees, acting like little kings. Head of the company is a multi billionaire despite the company including all subsidiaries only having ~15.000 employees (which aint small but for a multi billionaire at the top thats small), their company dynasty goes back for over 150 years now and their parents/grandparents were Nazi collaborateurs when they owned the company in the 1930s. Should tell you everything to how they see their coworkers now. Eventually theyre going to save their company into the ground because theyre consistently scaring off most talented young workers and are late in innovation to the competition in about everything, but I guess with that kind of family fortune it wont matter to them. I hope they drown in their golden bathtubs.

Im glad Im out of there, but I just feel bad for all those socially competent people still trying to jumpstart their career there, stuck there or talented but not courageous enough to leave. Even a few of the people in lower leadership roles that were good people. They deserve better than the wages theyre paid, the treatment they get, the budget they have to work with and the difficult and sometimes straight up horrible people they have to work with.

Sorry for the little rant. Im just very frustrated and hope some of my old colleagues get out of there asap.","5_1_1_1"

Make sure not to fall into the shame trap. I have the feeling that this looks more like a blame game. That is what I have seen frequently from Seniors. They give you a comment and run away and expect you to solve everything. 

So the minimum things you do: 

a) Better storytelling. Make sure that relevant people can understand the complexity of the use case. 

b) Take a senior onboard. Talks to your PO and make sure a senior is assigned to you. Make is part of their responsibility.

Literally had this same exact problem myself when I was getting started out. Totally normal, as you get more familiar with the data, the company, and the industry, you will get much clearer ideas of these types of things. You just need time on the job. 

Now, one recommendation for you is to chunk things down. you might not know how long xyz project will be, but you can identify what step 1 will be, you can probably estimate how long that will take, them step 2, etc. Caveat this all to leadership assuming no issues. I'm sure they understand unexpected things pop up all the time.

I know guys who have been at it ten years and are still expanding their expertise.

First step is to put out feelers at work. Talk to your manager about new work. You may be in a situation where they're giving you basic tasks because you're new and haven't realized you're ready for more.

If that doesn't work, then no worries. You have an easy job so can take a decent amount of time to yourself each week. Use this time for self direct learning. Auth, deployment options, model monitoring, networking, front end engineering, cloud engineering, there's a million things an MLE can be asked to do. Go learn some of it.

Then in 6-12 months you'll have 18-24 months experience as an MLE, lots of knowledge for interviews, and maybe some useful certificates if you take something like an AWS exam.","3"

Â Can you elaborate a bit on this? I want to get experience building an end-to-end pipeline; I currently have data stored in an S3 bucket and...that's it.

Then you have a Spark dataframe and can do pretty much anything imaginable with it. I like the dataframe API for spark best, as I think it makes for the cleanest code, but it's also possible to give SQL directly to spark. For the latter I think you have to use hive to register the S3 files in a metastore. 

One cool thing about spark is that once you've got your dataframe it no longer matters where it came from (for performance maybe sometimes, but not in general). So you can do funny things, like a join between an oracle table and a csv file, then a union with an mssql table, then aggregate and pull to pandas. This may not be as interesting for people working at companies with well-implemented storage systems, but if you're in a company like mine that has literally every product ever created running somewhere in production, it can reduce a lot of headaches.

But if you just have some smaller files on S3, spark might not be the best solution. It's pretty capable, but pretty complex, so it's only really worth it for pretty big data that doesn't fit into memory.","2_1_1"

OP said nothing about ""production"", I was under the assumption that SQL queries in this case (but not all obviously) were being used for data exploration and visualization given that other parts of the OP mentioned dashboards. This is exactly what R is good at relative to just about everything else (including python), and is primarily due to the fact that the tidyverse in particular is written to be ""ergonomic"" (in my opinion much more so that writing sql itself).

As for whether or not R is good enough to use ""in production"" which I take to mean here ""for a consumer-facing product whose failure would incur large costs for them and you as a company"", here's at least one company that thinks it is: [https://appsilon.com/](https://appsilon.com/)

Sagemaker instances are very convenient to just spin up and go on a project, but it is difficult to keep a consistent work environment there so I find that I have an ever growing list of terminal commands to execute every time I start them up.

SQL is as SQL does.

Databricks/Spark is quite slow for anything that isn't performed on a massive, efficiently stored dataset. I think the reliance on it is a little bit lazy in most cases because you can usually get  the same answers by intelligently sampling via a SQL query and perform the analysis 10x faster on a single machine.  Of course it isn't always obvious how to intelligently sample a dataset so it certainly has its uses.

R is only limited for analysis in that not everyone in my org really knows it so if it is anything going into a repo it has to be python. I mostly use it for ggplot when I need to make a good looking presentation.

I honestly only use VSCode because it is good for formatting and viewing large data files. I find it's forest of plugins intimidating so I have never really gotten it set up well for coding. That said I understand that it works great for many.

I hate Tableau. It's incredibly limited in much the same way as any GUI based dashboarding software but I seem to remember the Power BI of 4-5 years ago being more flexible than the current Tableau. If it was up to me, every DS team would have sufficient frontend support to use something like flask or shiny if they are building dashboards.","8"

Biggest issue is lack of a data modeling layer between the raw log event data in the database and Power BI. No data warehouse, no fact/dimension tables, no metrics. You either model in Power BI or reimplement everything from scratch in your query on raw logs. So there's no ""self service"" below the dashboard layer and different people will always get different answers to the same question.

But for real, the best networking Ive ever done that has gotten me jobs has not been related to said jobs. Always some extracurricular that wasnt work related. It needs to be something with a consistent crew, requires mixing up with people and working/exercising/whatevering with someone closely (see karate class) that you dont really know or didnt know before the class.Â 

The meetups I go to lean way too heavy towards people looking for jobs - like all of them that are tech related. Having manager in my title means I go, introduce myself, and get pestered for jobs the whole time when all I want to do is work on nest coding projects or see what others have made.Â 

P.S. bouldering gym is not particularly good. While some chains conveniently position near FAANG campus and are well stocked with SWE from said FAANG as members, everyone is kinda antisocial if you arent already in their little clique. Only really talked to 1-2 people at the local gym I was a member at a few blocks from Netflix campus. Only time I got any more attention was when I finally landed a dyno I had been working on and cycling through with some people.

I'm naturally an extreme introvert but I've gotten to know a large number of people and have a fairly robust professional network at this point.  

When I was in the nonprofit sector and working on behalf of a large local foundation, I got to know a lot of people because I did program evaluations (or they thought knowing me would help get them funded). I also completed a non-technical grad certificate (nonprofit management) when I did my stint in academia and I know a ton of people from grad school. 

One thing I do to help make favorable impressions is go out of my way to do favors whenever I can (e.g., show someone how to leverage the US Census' API or show them how to navigate a state site that houses data but is poorly organized). One time I helped someone I barely knew find employment for two people he had to let go; that former manager now happens to be the CFO of the organization that I work for and I think he appreciated me going out of my way to help his former team members even though it was 6-7 years ago. I didn't have anything certain to gain from doing so at the time, but it was in my power to help and it took less than an hour to help them make some connections that helped at least one of them land a job. And now I've got a friend in the CFO, which proved useful last year when I screwed up getting an invoice paid before the fiscal year ended (he worked some accounting magic to transfer the funds to this fiscal year). Often times, Finance is not so accommodating. 

So be kind. Do things for others because it's a small world and things can come back to you if you pay if forward. People remember acts of kindness, particularly when you don't have anything to immediately gain from doing so. Answer random emails from acquaintances of acquaintances. 

At this point, I'm fairly confident that if I were to be laid off tomorrow, I have connections that would help me find a new job quickly. I definitely don't want to test that, but I'm pretty sure I'm well-situated. So basically I networked by doing small (and occasionally not-so-small) favors whenever the opportunities presented themselves.","12"

How do you guys network? This advice comes from me who has been an international conference producer. Figure out what you love talking about, and then find who you love talking about it with. Spend time with them - your knowledge and conversations will set the path for you to explore and meet all kinds of people. The most important think is that networking happens organically. That means go and enjoy spending time with people first - hell, go and do drugs if you dont know what that natural connection with people should feel like ( I recommend getting stoned and going from there)","13"

It was an internal transfer. My boss was building the data science organization, and liked an NLP tool I built on the side with a coworker. I worked there for another 1.5 years, and moved to a big tech company, where I've been for four years.

My recommendation is either to transfer to a data science role internally, or to apply to a company with data analysts that also has a data science team. The next best thing is to work as a data analyst where you're working with engineers on a regular basis. Aim for a place where you can get a more senior title fast, which you'll really only know after you've interviewed there.

If you're young, I'd also consider getting a Masters. What you'd focus on depends on what you're interested in. Almost anything in STEM is fine, but I'd look at Statistics or CS.

You are likely going to have a tough time becoming a data scientist at a new company without at least three years of full time experience and (maybe) an advanced degree, especially in this market. I got lucky, but I also had a lot of things on my resume to help out: an undergraduate math degree from a top university, that first job was at a well-known and respected company, and I'm an average software engineer, which makes me much better than most data scientists at coding. I don't think you need an advanced degree to be a good data scientist; however, most data scientists I meet have one. There's a lot of value in having one.","8"

Once you have an idea, say, using LangChain to build a unique chatbot, use a cloud platform to host it.

It's not super terrible, but it can be a bit draining. The good and bad side is that a lot of questions you'll come across are similar so getting a few key answers to them is a good strategy, then you rework it slightly for each job. But I also have ADHD so repetitive rote work like this makes me bounce right off most of the time.

There are also different strategies you can take when job hunting. You are lots of stuff about ""x applications over y months"" but I think that in a field like data science, quality trumps quantity when putting applications in. 

It's also important not to get your hopes pinned on any one job, more than a few I thought I would get easily but I missed out on, you can't let stuff like that get to you.

We had a situation within the last week or so where we found something wasn't working as well as what analysis of it over the previous two years showed. In that case, I think it was absolutely appropriate for them to want to better understand the methodology because we had two years worth of data that had shown that it was effective (even though it was the exact same methodology that had been used in 2022 and 2023).

On the other hand, most other times their understanding nothing more than based on a hunch/instinct or faulty assumptions. The empirical evidence--often just descriptive analysis--is questioned because it doesn't support their preexisting assumptions that have been easily disproven. 

So I guess clinging onto vacuous truths in the face of strong contradictory evidence is more of what I was talking about. ""If X, then Y"" is always true when X isn't satisfied. So our report discredits the X=&gt;Y hypothesis by showing X wasn't the case in the first place and then corrects the premise. Showing X=&gt;Y is incorrect because X isn't true in the first place represents a different proposition than showing X!=&gt;Y.","1_1_2"

Also there is no clear process to promote widely used data models to be owned by the DE team. A couple jobs ago, all DS were working in the same dbt directory. This forced us to keep it very organized and we would all become relatively proficient in dbt. As a result we actually wrote tests, thought about materialization, partition etc.. and overall data quality was a lot better.

It is of the hardest things you can do in data science, because everything seems like it worked.

Causal modeling will always give you a result, and it will always look plausible, and it will always be biased because of unmeasured confounders or mis-specification of the problem.

Machine learning methodologies can be mathematically complex, but in many cases can be treated as black boxes for prediction purposes. With machine learning you can throw in a bunch of predictive variables, choose from a menu of methods, and get an objective measure of mean squared error or whatever to assess how well the model predicts.

Routine analysis? I'm usually trying to find insight to recommend to business. Day-to-day is stakeholder meetings, leading meetings, meeting with Product managers, writing presentations, monitoring, etc... 

Annoying part is that if there is no lift and a recommendation that I give is to change their Ad/Copy, they don't do it. And sometimes the product just sucks regardless of the marketing. It's a steady field, but that part got frustrating. You feel like you're making a difference and there's high visibility, but ehh, I like math. And there's more paperwork with causal - so much paperwork. 

However, I will say what you learn from Causal is so helpful for ML. All the communication/presentation helped me soo much in ML to get the projects that I wanted and to convince business to try newer algorithms. Providing business-value/being able to speak their language is underrated.

If you want to do things like meta-analysis of experiments, then working in product growth would be good cause you can get velocity and run a lot of small changes. So you'll have the opportunity to do fancy stuff if you can keep up with the volume. That said stuff like this is very plug and chug.

If you want to do things like econometrics, then you should consider marketing science, specifically around incrementality testing. Marketers typically don't like turning off ad-spend and will generally rely on attribution, so you need a data driven marketing team to be able to work on things like this. You can also try to measure brand impact, but would avoid because it's very very fuzzy. 

I'd say if you're most interested in cool techniques, I'd try to work as a data scientist building an experimentation or inference platform - so something like statsig or optimizely.","4"

There are also many causal inference positions in state and Federal government agencies (state health departments, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CDC, etc.) and academia (e.g., hospitals associated with Yale, Tufts, and Harvard Universities hire statisticians to work on public health).

The pharmaceutical industry hires a ton of statisticians to help administer and analyze clinical trials. Pharmaceutical companies focus more on experiments like randomized clinical trials (RCTs). 

I've worked with causal inference using observational data in the healthcare field, where it's not practical or unethical to perform RCTs. In my opinion, this is more challenging and interesting than experiments since you don't have the convenience of randomly assigning patients to treatment groups - rather you have to find clever techniques to simulate an experiment.","8"

Remaining 10% is me reading about the field so I get better at it. 

Mostly I use instrument variables in experimental settings to get the benefit of opting-in to a marketing program (most marketing is just exposure to an ad, but mostly we are interested in the benefit of opting in to whatever program we are trying to sell which is best answered by IV methods).

For non-experimental settings we use propensity score matching.

The project plan can read like random assortments of letters that have little meaning to those not very well versed in the underlying technology. Even different teams on the same project often have little understanding of what each other do and relationships can fray quickly\*. Surprise problems arise that no one knows how long will take to solve, and just about every estimate anyone gives the PM is a guess.

I think a reasonable response to my post above is that absolutely everyone really struggles with managing large DS projects, including traditional project managers. It could also be colored by the fact that I've tended to work on relatively cutting edge/unique projects.

It's just my experience that traditional PMs don't bring that much to the table. They just end up setting up meetings, sending emails, and updating budget documents. Which is great! I love that there's someone to do that, but it leaves a lot of key PM duties to other folks, and I've carried those responsibilities many times.

* It's not quite true in the US that analyst is entry level and data scientist is senior. Are you non-US?
* Regardless, if you want to work in the field you'll need a higher education degree to be competitive, there are simply way too many candidates and title is a first natural filter for recruiters.
* If you have a job lined up already and are kind of burnt out from school, what's the real issue? Sounds like you're in a great position. Finish school, get some proper job experience and in 2 years think what you want to do. Consider a PhD in something mathematical. But masters are perfectly valid too.","3"

So for a lot of people it becomes a function of having gotten enough building blocks in undergrad to complement that with some self-learning and the right entry-level job to develop the rest - and it's sometimes easier/more efficient to just get a master's.

And that just means that instead of spending 2 years in a MS program that gets you in the door for a DS role, it may take you 4-5 years in a DA role, maybe a job change or 2, and some personal time spent honing your skills to get into that first role where you are now building towards a DS career.

I also think some majors are better suited for that career path - namely the ones that are more focused on the math/stats side of things. Coding is easier to learn on your own/on the job (or at least people are much less judgemental of people who learned to code that way).

Now, the other thing that happens to people that go the DA route - you may just never want to switch to DS. You may find yourself 4 years in getting promoted to being an Analytics Manager, and all of the sudden you could be looking at taking a paycut and demotion to go be a data scientist. Is it worth it? Maybe. Maybe not. Depends on what you value.

My personal advice: don't assume you need an MS until you're in a job search and you find yourself unable to get the job you want because you don't have a MS. And do not assume that  you know what job you're going to want in 4 years - work first. You'll learn a lot about yourself.","4"

A few practical thoughts about masters, job prospects, and income:

* Opportunity cost of lost income is real, especially if you're available to invest a significant amount of salary early in life for compounding returns
* Online, part time masters are a good option - you can still work and they are much, much cheaper while still being reputable
* In bad markets like today's, degrees probably matter more than usual. But they definitely matter less than relevant experience
* Re: relevant experience, the field is getting a lot more domain-specialized lately. It's worth thinking about if there are specific industries you want to target and may be a more important early-career decision than masters vs. not

I work as a DA for a non-tech F50. My thoughts:

1. DA vs.DS is more of an online debate than a real life difference (I can't speak for trad tech / fang). It seems like you're more concerned with the seniority aspect of it than the marginal difference in roles.

You can learn. While getting paid rather than accrue debt. And if internally the company has data science teams you can get a foot in the door using any data variant, and work relationships to keep taking a swing at crossing over. A good mentor will do more for you than university coursework. Universities feed theory and are often deficient in practical building. The 'that's great, what do I do with this?'. A good mentor can help guide you to practical projects to apply techniques through building.

Useful frame is your job is not your work, your job is to get a better job. Whether that may be more pay, or more flexibility, or getting access to one of the skills needed for the job you really want. Can use that as a barometer to hop roles. Seek out the item to drop on your resume for what you really want.

As a system for professional life skill-stacking is useful. Each skill you have adds another parameter you can bring to business questions. When every candidate is equally credentialed at some point, an interesting skill-stack can see things other candidates cannot. This is freeing as whatever role you have you can always go out and add another complimentary skill. Ratchet up iterating on your foot-in-the-door diploma.","17"

He/she deleted their comment cause they knew it was bullshit what they were saying.

The thing is, heres my take on a PhD in stats. My masters degree was covering the first year of PhD stats coursework. My department is small and does not have a PhD program, and the MS students are the PhD students of the department. My professor is old school and is teaching the course rigorously in hopes one of us goes to a PhD we are prepared. Its not watered down by any means.

Frankly, Id do a PhD if it means I get to sink my teeth into research immediately. I love learning, but I love learning if its going to help me in my research. A PhD in stats right after my MS would require  me to take arbitrary math classes that dont actually add any value. Like asymptotic statistics is the only really useful course after a masters because you actually need that in your research. Your proposing any eatimators? You better show the asymptotic results. Id be happy to learn that stuff.

But other courses, like measure theoretic probability? Complete waste of time and I have no interest in taking such a course, and taking a qualifier on it. Frankly Im confident I can get started in research after a course on asymptotic statistics, without the useless math classes PhD programs make you take. I dont need to prove to a committee that I can do math. I know I can do math, I know I can learn new math effectively, and program.

Right after my bachelors in statistics I spent the summer before my masters doing research with a biostatistician on high dimensional regression. Reading the OG papers on the lasso, group lasso, and its variant. I read all of it, multiple times, and read the theoretical results and was able to summarize to my PI why we need new methods beyond the lasso for what were trying to do. Didnt need measure theory for it.

Now in my MS Im studying nonparametric regression. I know real analysis, I know statistical theory, and now Im able to dive into kernel methods and smoothing splines. The other day I didnt know what a RKHS was. So I googled it, read some lecture notes on it, boom, now I know why they are so huge in the splines literature.

If given the choice of working on research/technical data science problems in the industry, vs taking 2 more years of coursework, and then qualifying exams, and then researching and solving problems, Im taking the first option, regardless of the three letters next to my name after doing the latter.

Its a hot take, but 95% of the coursework PhD stats courses make you take after the casella Berger sequence is practically pointless. Read asymptotic theory and thats all you need. Again, this is for academic research here.

I have read through all of the Netflix tech blogs on design of experiments and causal inference in the context of what they do, and Im able to understand those papers, with just an MS.

I just know that I dont need to do a PhD for the sake of proving I can do research. I can do research now. I can learn anything I want to, whenever I want to, and learn it well, and thats because Ive spent my time learning stuff on my own in undergrad.

But yeah, if PhD programs didnt waste my time in the first two years, Id do it. But if Im being offered 125k to do causal inference and design of experiments with my MS in Stats, then a PhD is out of question.","1_2_1_1_1_1"

My MS program is at a department where there is no PhD program. The MS students are the PhD students of the department. Which means if my department wants to ensure one of us decides to go for a PhD, we go through the first year PhD sequence of coursework in our masters coursework. Many of the students who go on for a PhD program after jump right into year two coursework. If that tells you how rigorous our MS program is, we dont just do watered down shit like most MS programs. Since we have no PhD students, the MS students get all the opportunities to do statistical consulting, part time data science work, TAing and what not. So definitely, my MS program in stats right now is fully funded, so I definitely would not call it a cash cow.


Furthermore, I told someone else this. The PhD level coursework is bullshit. You dont need half the coursework they make you take in the first two years to do research. A course in asymptotic statistics is the only coursework you even need to start working on research at a PhD level. Measure theory is pointless. So frankly I dont really find it impressive or cool that PhD students can do measure theory. At the end of the day your building statistical methods and if your publishing it requires you to know how to write code (which I can do very well), and know asymptotic theory, which, as many professors in my department have told me doesnt require measure theory.

So all that to say, with an MS I could definitely do research. Frankly I dont need half the bullshit coursework they make you take just to take for research.","1_2_1_1_1_2"

How would you even establish the asymptotic properties of U statistics without knowing the backwards martingale convergence theorem (for instance)?

But in general yes, for the non academic job market you dont need hard courses. Most CS folks working in ML dont even know baby Rudin level real analysis. They know some basic linear algebra and calculus. For the non academic job market, work experience as a professional developer trumps all math knowledge, degrees etc (outside of a few quant and research oriented roles and also the Econ job market which requires a PhD). So from that POV, its best to intern as early as you can and build experience.

Didnt require measure theory to understand the papers, digest the information, and propose the method and write the simulations to show how our methods worked compared to others. At the end of the day all that work was convex optimization, which was real analysis (which I had).

And to your point on measure theory for asymptotic statistics these set of lecture notes here are the lecture notes for the asymptotic theory course at penn state. The professor says in his intro that measure theory isnt needed for it:

Its just simply teaching the necessary measure theoretic probability alongside the core stats theory instead of requiring it as a prerequisite course.

In any case I disagree with the premise. Learning more analysis (and the associated point set topology) can make some probabilistic concepts more intuitive rather than abstruse. A case in point is the abstract conditional expectation, which easily exists but is often less intuitive than regular Markov kernels which need topological assumptions to exist http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jtc5/papers/ConditioningAsDisintegration.pdf","1_2_1_1_1_2_1_1_1"

Measure theory is only useful when your methods require the use of probability theory. If its a methodological innovation no one gives a shit about the radon-nikodyn theorem. Clearly you didnt understand what I meant by the stein shrinkage literature or the lasso literature, because none of those require measure theory to understand, and the fact that you just said the stein shrinkage literature is equivalent to reg y x means you havent done any serious reading of academic papers ever in your life. 

Anyways, Again, its much better to learn the measure theory as you go, cause youre gonna forget the half the shit you learned in that measure theory course anyway.

It likely depends a lot on the field and the funding situations can also be fairly complicated. Based upon conversations I've seen, one of more common scenarios is that someone applies to a bunch of schools and is accepted to one without funding (i.e., a weak accept) and hope that they can secure funding after enrolling. In other cases their funding was tied to a specific project that ended up falling through before finishing.  


&gt;I would also like to know which universities charge tuition for doctorates its mad!

At least in the US, I'm not aware of any that don't technically charge tuition. However, what that actually means can get really complicated since the impression I've gotten is that even when a PhD student is paying tuition, they aren't paying the sticker price listed for graduate tuition. Plus, administratively, the student may not pay, but the department could be paying on their behalf out of funds allocated by the university to support graduate students. I've gotten into some arguments with grad students about tuition since a couple have claimed it's just an accounting trick - it's not  since there is still overhead to cover - but they also aren't wrong that once you enter research only it tends to be a lot higher than it should be (in most departments).","3_1_2_1_1_1_1_1"

I definitely see some highly successful people in my current company (in both IC and Managerial roles) who managed to rise up the corporate ladder despite only having an MS degree and no PhD.

You could also decide in the future you want to pivot careers and study something else to get there. Thats what I did in my 30s (from marketing to analytics/DS). What you plan for yourself at 18 or 22 isnt always what you still want to be doing in your 30s and 40s.","10"

You know what's even more ""weird"". Spending half a decade grinding metrics in academia with a salary far below your peers in industry - in many cases largely to be able to get a work permit. 

Except in the cases if you really wish you advance the bleeding edge of knowledge. Apart from few positions at a handful of companies (like advancing ML research at Google/Meta), this kind of research will be largely done in academia. Besides if people think working in academia as a professor is sitting at your desk for a whole day thinking about scientific problems, you are in for a treat. 

If you keep the learning mindset in industry you can also learn a lot, while getting paid a lot more. My approach is to always find something at work that can advance your skills and make you more employable in the future. Whether that's working alongside engineers (learn model deployments!), product managers (learn about product management!), SMEs or other data scientists. You'll learn different things than academia, but IMO you have to keep the mindset.

For example, I have seen other people with a ""oh man I want to do DS and all I got is making slides for a VP/CEO at a startup"" approach which I understand, but I feel like should be also spun positively ""you get a close-up inside view how to (or not to lol) run a startup"".

I also went back and did my PhD after working for a couple years and there is *a lot* of truth to this. Doing a PhD can be good for the soul if it's a bit life goal, but I tended to notice that students who were doing the PhD ""the next thing after a Masters (or undergrad)"" tended to struggle a lot with motivation (even worse if they were doing a PhD because others thought they should do one). 

There's a couple fields where going back for a PhD after working for awhile is common (e.g., political science and public policy) and there are other fields where the PhD is effectively becoming mandatory if you want to advance to oversight or management roles (e.g., biology and chemistry) and typically these students tend to be very motivated to get done as quickly as possible and already have good time and project management skills.

However, this is really to say that beyond practical considerations of funding, there's really only two reasons to get a PhD:

1. You have a burning desire to do one that's largely driven by interest in a subject.  
2. You know definitively that it will be a help and/or requirement for you future career plans.

Beyond that there's not a lot of compelling reasons to do one since a good Masters program (thesis based) will give you the majority of the same technical skills you get out of a PhD.","14_3"

Yeah but those c suite positions pay handsomely, which is not true of most PhD-required positions. I too considered a PhD, but ultimately decided an MBA would be a better return on my investment if I ever decided to continue my education (which I have not at this time). Shame that our society values bull shitters over researchers, but it is what it is, I didn't ask to play the game but since I have to, might as well play to win.

Now, with an MS (assuming you've got some common sense and a decent work ethic), you should be able to support a middle class lifestyle with that degree in an analytics and maybe even data science job. An MBA and a PhD are by no means ""necessary"" for the field as a whole, but they are necessary for certain positions. Just depends what positions you want.","16"

No.

&gt;When I interviewed for a role the hiring manager (who had no background in anything stem) told me I should consider an MBA to round myself out.

Not anymore. That mentality applied 10-20 years ago especially to like IT, but not today and definitely not to DS.

&gt;From my limited experience it feels like MBAs are just degrees people get to prove to a higher up that they have the credential to get a c suite position.

Honestly, even this is going out of style. So back 20 years ago, you could be 30 years old and getting an MBA was a great step to advance your career mid-career. That could be the thing that allowed you to jump from Manager to Director or Director to VP. 

That doesn't really happen anymore. These days I mostly see relatively young people get an MBA as soon as they can, and what that does is normally open doors to some of the big brand companies who are normally heavy on MBAs (management consulting, Pepsi, Coca Cola, Generall Mills, etc.).

But even that only applies to more traditional functions like finance, marketing, etc. It does not apply to DS - the best thing on your resume as a data scientist is more data science work experience. Always. Better than a MS, better than a PhD. 

&gt;Is there a natural cap with a MS in something technical (stats) for example?

No. There is no cap for any educational background - it becomes primarily a function of you being good at your job, getting promoted, finding new bigger roles, etc. 

The cap that most people hit has nothing to do with education and everything to do with personal skillset and preference. The reality is that not everyone is built or wants to be a CEO. To be honest, once you become a Director you actually may realize you don't even want to be a VP. That's where I am at - I have been someone that aggressively looked to get raises and promotions thinking I was always going to want to keep going up, and I'm sitting here at 40 as a Director at a Fortune 100 company with like 10 direct reports and I have *zero* interest in going any higher. I make good enough money, I like my job, I do not like my boss' job. Maybe I will change my mind in 5 years, but right now I can see myself coasting indefinitely in this role.

All that to say - don't worry about a cap, but definitely don't worry about a cap with an MS in stats and most definitely don't worry about a cap that you may not actually want to hit when you get close enough to it.","20"

My masters degree was covering the first year of PhD stats coursework. My department is small and does not have a PhD program, and the MS students are the PhD students of the department. My professor is old school and is teaching the course rigorously in hopes one of us goes to a PhD we are prepared. Its not watered down by any means.

Frankly, Id do a PhD if it means I get to sink my teeth into research immediately. I love learning, but I love learning if its going to help me in my research. A PhD in stats right after my MS would require  me to take arbitrary math classes that dont actually add any value. Like asymptotic statistics is the only really useful course after a masters because you actually need that in your research. Your proposing any eatimators? You better show the asymptotic results. Id be happy to learn that stuff.

But other courses, like measure theoretic probability? Complete waste of time and I have no interest in taking such a course, and taking a qualifier on it. Frankly Im confident I can get started in research after a course on asymptotic statistics, without the useless math classes PhD programs make you take. I dont need to prove to a committee that I can do math. I know I can do math, I know I can learn new math effectively, and program. 

Right after my bachelors in statistics I spent the summer before my masters doing research with a biostatistician on high dimensional regression. Reading the OG papers on the lasso, group lasso, and its variant. I read all of it, multiple times, and read the theoretical results and was able to summarize to my PI why we need new methods beyond the lasso for what were trying to do. Didnt need measure theory for it.

Now in my MS Im studying nonparametric regression. I know real analysis, I know statistical theory, and now Im able to dive into kernel methods and smoothing splines. The other day I didnt know what a RKHS was. So I googled it, read some lecture notes on it, boom, now I know why they are so huge in the splines literature.

If given the choice of working on research/technical data science problems in the industry, vs taking 2 more years of coursework, and then qualifying exams, and then researching and solving problems, Im taking the first option, regardless of the three letters next to my name after doing the latter. 

Its a hot take, but 95% of the coursework PhD stats courses make you take after the casella Berger sequence is practically pointless. Read asymptotic theory and thats all you need. Again, this is for academic research here.

I have read through all of the Netflix tech blogs on design of experiments and causal inference in the context of what they do, and Im able to understand those papers, with just an MS.

I just know that I dont need to do a PhD for the sake of proving I can do research. I can do research *now*. I can learn anything I want to, whenever I want to, and learn it well, and thats because Ive spent my time learning stuff on my own in undergrad.  

But yeah, if PhD programs didnt waste my time in the first two years, Id do it. But if Im being offered 125k to do causal inference and design of experiments with my MS in Stats, then a PhD is out of question.","24_1"

People always seem to focus on tuition, which is nontrivial if un(der)funded. But really the biggest cost is forgoing the opportunity to work full-time and gain years of experience in the field. 

Even if you're fully funded doctoral student with a decent stipend in a low cost of living city, you're still making half or a third the salary range for someone with a Masters. Say your stipend is $45k and you could make $90k. Maybe you finish in 4 years, but most likely it takes you 5 or even 6. $45k x 5 = $225k. Now discount for time and further account for the fact that a Masters plus 3 years of full-time work experience typically makes more than someone fresh out of a PhD (I'm assuming Masters is two years and PhD is 5). And, for most positions, MS+3yoe is a more attractive candidate than a PhD+0yoe (employers generally don't count years as a grad assistant as full-time work experience). It equalizes somewhere around MS+8yoe and PhD+5yoe and beyond that PhD dominates as the marginal returns on years of experience beyond 8-10 years are pretty small. But again, discount for time. And don't underestimate that living some of the best years of your life on a grad stipend really sucks.

That's what I loved about working for a health insurance company. It was nothing like what I expected. Our goals and the goals of our clients were in a fair amount of alignment.

For example, a major cost is people getting readmitted into a hospital after a previous hospital stay. We obviously don't want to spend more money re-admitting our client into a hospital and the client definitely doesn't want to be in the hospital again.  To help deal with this, one of the models a team was working on was early intervention by the primary care practitioner to address an issue before it requires re-hospitalization.

Another project I worked on was trying to find methods to lower the amount of time our clients got stuck on the phone trying to have their issue resolved. Dealing with a health issue is already stressful enough, you shouldn't have to be stuck on a phone for hours being rerouted from one person to another just to make sure your insurance company pays up.  

On our end, customer service personnel are one of our two largest labor costs. If we can lower the amount of time our clients have to speak to people that lowers the total amount of hours that customer service has to spend dealing with a client, which lowers our cost. Everybody's happy.","1_1_1"

I'm sure there are health insurance companies that do shady stuff like that, but the company I work for absolutely did not.

If you do it right, an insurance companies incentives and their clients incentives can be in alignment.

We built models that helped our clients, because ultimately it helped us too. We never built any models that arbitrarily denied people coverage of procedures that they needed.

We did build models that would help alert their primary care physician of an issue to keep them from being readmitted to the hospital.  We built models that work to encourage clients to take their medication, which keeps them healthier, and means less hospital stays that we have to pay for.

We even built models that helped do mundane things like lower the amount of time our clients spent talking on customer service. We wanted our clients to be able to get the answers to the questions that they needed as quickly as possible and to decrease their need to call back. 

They spend less time on the phone and get what they need, which is great for them. We expect fewer hours of our customer service reps talking with the clients which saves us money, which is great for us.

Like how would I know the precision or AUC ROC or AUC PR or RMSE is declining for a model in production unless new labels are in the pipeline and the model runs inference on newly labeled data?

Right?

This is actually a hard problem. If you train a good model, it goes into production, and as part of the workflow *people fix issues the model identifies!* then you'd anticipate the model performs worse in production. Imagine you predict whether someone arriving to the ER is going to die in 12 hours, so you trigger a workflow to intervene. Clearly if people are dying less, you have a model success! But it looks like your model is failing... right?


Some approaches

1. Run your model in shadow mode until your collect a statistically meaningful sample in the production environment. 

2. Temporal comparison - pre/post incidence rates. This is unfortunately subject to sectoral dynamics -- an overall rate would mask baseline

3. Use your prediction model as baseline (this is very common)

4. Build a separate model for baseline incidence rates based on known factors (again, think hospital, % of capacity might non-monotonically impact death rates because people are too busy or have capacity to address risk of death)

There are several approaches, but what a wonderful problem to have that the models you produce affect the real world in a meaningful way!","1"

As an example I work in real estate rental estimation, we get new batches of data every week, this data is already labeled (aka we already have the rental price). I simply compile error metrics of our prediction versus the real price for this new data.

When I used to work in predictive maintenance we only had sensor data from the equipment, if we had labels there would be no point in having a model, so what we monitored were metrics like number of alarms, time between alarms and others, we had performance metrics but those required labeling by maintenance engineers (aka the feedback on whether the alarm we issued was false or not).","3"

I don't need a model to tell me the pump is broken, I can just look at it, I need one that will tell me it's going to break soon.

But in some cases even if you have labels the model is still useful, in the real estate example I mentioned the new data has a price, so you might think what use is a model that estimates price? The answer is that the model is not limited to the properties in the dataset, it can generate a price for a property anywhere in the country, or estimate a new price for an existing property if it had an extra bedroom.","3_1_1"

Follow up question on your real estate example:

If your labels are auto generated from only one source of data, arent you assuming that the model will be good at measuring prices of houses even though it was actually only trained on the specific types of houses that were labeled in your dataset?

Like if you can only label 10% of all houses, and the  build a model using those 10% of labels, you are in essence training on how to predict only 10% of houses right? I guess the hope is that the dataset is not biased in an obvious way and that you can in fact generalize","3_1_1_1"

But the issue you mentioned is still valid and it's part of the reason the model is actually several different models that generate different outputs.

Like, say you predict a customer will churn, but they dont or they do, that real life result is recorded and at some interval reported as a summary stat with other predictions and outcomes for that model. So youre comparing RMSE or AUC or whatever from training, hold out, and from real life in production.Â 

Then you set some threshold that triggers some set of actions to resolve model drift or unacceptable performance. Maybe it triggers a retraining pipeline with all the new data youve since recorded. Maybe it reverts to an older version model that is more stable. Maybe it sets off alarms on lager duty and wakes data scientists up at 3am to start ad hoc experimentation and a complete rework of their research up to that point. You get the idea.Â 

Not too different than any program or system really. I put new tires on my car. I check their condition regularly and reinforce to proper pressures. As I document them loosing pressure more rapidly (more frequent re inflation) I start the process of getting new tires, whatever that is.Â 

In a big mature company, I would expect a robust framework to exist for abstracting each step of the DS process in a production pipeline: data versioning, data quality monitoring, pipeline monitoring, feature stores with versioning and DQ, train-test split versioning and automation, training and model versioning, and so on. There would likely be a framework for monitoring testing of real life observed outcome compared to model predictions, recording those, and allowing recall into some system for management them.","4"

In general I would say: 
1) If you are more junior than that , this is very unusual 
2) If you are already at that level, you will find that from now on part of the job is to add value to the company through thought leadership. It is just simply not going to be the case that for every initiative you get clear requirements from the business- mainly because they arent experts in your field, like you (how would they even know what an ML opportunity even looks like&?) 
3) Generally speaking, at all levels of DS you should still only pursue something concretely if it makes sense and will add value to the business- or, make your reservations known, disagree, and then do it anyways, and give 100%. In industry your leadership has the last word. 
4) in general , most of your projects should have buy in before you spend lots of time and a clear path to market- talk to other teams if thats not the case - goals help here
5) Crucially in DS- not all projects should be like this. You need to be 1-2 steps ahead of the business - that means not everything is fully specced. / could be foundational
6) Lastly, remember- you are part of the business. In DS , your role is a bit unusual in that if you want to succeed and add value, you should NOT always just do what you are asked (ex-my above, imo) At the core you are a problem solver - that means in general its sometimes necessary to identify opportunities and get after them - whether others see them yet or not. Balance this vs. the fact you work in a company- you will not succeed over the long term without others

Anyhow, I've worked with incompetent management before, trying to push ML on problems that can be solved with a simple sql query. You just push back! You should be able to explain why a solution won't work using reason and mathematical proof (as a data scientist), but you should also provide an alternative. If your manager insists on ML, they also should be able to justify with evidence or examples. If you can't explain your position, then it is weak! Perhaps you are the incompetent data scientist?!. If they can't explain theirs, then keep pushing back until they can or leave them.

Let me try to explain without revealing organization. We have a service that is used by millions of Americans daily. Our largest customers can get that service without paying upfront, even though it is not encouraged. They will have to reconcile payment up to 45 days after. Many bad actors exploit that loophole and try to create counterfeit that resembles our biggest customers and use our services with no intention of paying. We can know how much money we lose after 45 days when payment is not reconciled. So the use of machine learning was not pushed from the business that is involved in day-to-day work. It is being pushed from C-level executives who hear that machine learning is used successfully to solve fraud and don't want to hear no for an answer. Our manager is no different. He wants to hear that we are using fancy machine learning algorithms to solve this problem. He doesn't care about details. There are easier things that could be done to stop our customers from using the service without upfront payment, such as payment verification before rendering service. They think implementing that is hard, but some middle management thinks machine learning is this silver bullet that would bring value just like that. Other solutions would allow service usage for customers without paying for some time but send multiple warning letters so that they make sure to send payment up in the future. Even in a rare case we develop a machine learning solution, it is entirely unclear how it is going to be used. Are we going to refuse service based on a machine learning output? That would be all over the news because this is a well-known organization that is used by millions of people. This push is being led by skill-less middle managers and consultants who want billable hours.","17_1"

This is a typical case for ML! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;who hear that machine learning is used successfully to solve fraud and don't want to hear no for an answer. 

They heard correctly, specially that their case (customers spoofing/creating counterfeit accounts) is something that ML is mitigating everyday for many large corporates. It is more likely that the C-level suite need to invest in the right leadership and talent to enable this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He wants to hear that we are using fancy machine learning algorithms to solve this problem

To be fair, this is not a challenge and is often played both ways. Leadership like to hear that their scientists are using fancy stuff. On the other hand, scientists use the simplest logics and sell their accomplishments back to the leadership as the fanciest state-of-the-art AI (e.g. create a rule-based logic and call it ML or decision tree, average two rules and call it ""ensemble ML"", etc.). You sad it yourself ""He doesn't care about details."", so where is the problem here?!

Look, what you are describing is a typical struggle that you'd face in any large company you go to. It is part of what makes the job fun, and it is why your title says ""scientist"" because you are supposed to discover and invent! you are not an engineer   
 and you are not a policy maker!. There will always be something that works better (e.g. verification system), but the business leaders may never want to implement and they have their legitimate reasons. e.g., maybe their competitive edge is that they don't enforce a verification system, or maybe their competitor doesn't use a verification system so it is very risky for them, or maybe they are in a critical growth phase and want to just pull traffic. So they will favor exploring other options (e.g. ML) even if they can never be as effective. ML is not supposed to beat the verification system in this case, all you need is to just beat the current baseline, and that is something you can definitely do as long as your company has the data!","17_1_1"

On the ML methods side, Graph ML/algorithms. There's overlap with generative AI but a lot of it has nothing to do with generation. It's also a bit off the beaten path from classical tabular ML -- feels fresh but not oversaturated with hype like computer vision a few years back and more recently LLMs. GNNs seem to be in fairly early and active stages of development. Maybe this will be the new craze in a few years and you can get ahead of it.  


On the engineering side, it's been cool thinking more about ML systems design and taking a much broader view on the life cycle of a model. A few good books have come out on the topic pretty recently e.g. Designing Machine Learning Systems and Reliable Machine Learning. These cover a lot of ground that doesn't come up (but definitely should) in traditional ML training/classes. Maybe you're more focused on learning new methods, but this has definitely broadened my perspective and in a way the key takeaway is how good model development can never be siloed from a broader systems view.","6"

I got my masters 4 years ago and fired off I think around 200 applications total. haven't gotten a DS position but have gotten increasingly higher responsibility analyst roles. 2 new roles since graduation.

For me, it's something like 15-25 applications for an interview. 2-4 interviews for an offer. Obviously not going to take every offer. And when I get a new job I don't really send off any applications for the first 6 months to a year or so. Also worth mentioning that a lot of the roles I apply for a ""reach"", in other words a snowball's chance in hell but it takes 15 minutes to apply and it would be life-changing for me so why not roll the dice.

Idk how people are doing 1000+ applications in a few months. There's just not that many job openings becoming available unless you're applying all over the world and/or really scraping the barrel. It's tough out there but if you don't have a single interview offer after let's say the first 50, you gotta rethink what you're doing. Rethink your resume, what kind of roles you're applying to in the first place, etc. You have to be strategic about it - small stepping stones over time rather than one giant big break leap. Not saying don't roll the dice, but I am saying don't only apply to reach jobs.

Also the rate of interviews is not uniformly distributed. Sometimes I send out 30 and get nothing then stop for a few months. Then I'll send one out and get it. Jobs I think I would be a slam dunk for ghost me yet jobs i think I'm nowhere near qualified for will hire me. It's strange how it works like that.","14"

Solid resume with internship experience and several publications on some ML papers at some pretty high profile international conferences. He was unable to get a single interview for the whole of 2023 and recently was sent back home due to his visa expiring. I don't really know how many apps he sent out but I know he had been at it for months and really ramped it up closer to his visa deadline.

In contrast, my resume is pretty lackluster due to my complete lack of internship and industry experience, however I am a US citizen. I sent out about 800, heard back from three, and accepted the offer for one just a few weeks ago. The market is ROUGH for everybody, and being international just makes it 10x harder.

The job itself was dead easy and I wanted to be a DA, so I got to work visualising the data they had, improving the quality of the data, categorising it more, showing trends, etc. Slowly, over the course of the year, I was given more and more DA tasks and the responsibilities I was supposed to have just got moved to someone else. I also snapped up a DA apprenticeship course too, which further solidified my position as the guy who does the DA stuff for my department. By the end of the month I should be a fully fledged DA, after constantly ranting and raving about the importance of data and how I can use it to benefit the business. 

So, yeah, 10 applications, and the one application that wasn't for a DA position was the one that got me a DA job in the end.

I said in the post I was a SWE for a DoD contractor before grad school...so thats what I was doing.

&gt;why did you leave it to get a PhD in astrophysics only to decide not to pursue a professorship.

I left that job to get a PhD because I wanted to get a PhD. Lots of people get Phds without intending to go Tenure Track. In STEM, less than 0.5% of PhDs end up in TT positions...

&gt;Do postdocs not last 2-3 years max for astrophysics?

Postdocs last up to three years. I am in my first year. So i have more than two years left.

Also show pain points, like time wasted, mental fatigue, having to contact multiple people, delays that that involves, reputational risk there (take too long to get back to client, diminishes their confidence in your product or service and/or ability to deliver). Maybe your boss HATES having to call this person or that. That's a tangible cost and pain point to him. That's value. Know that and use it in your decision making and frame it that way. DD is your friend. 

Personal example: Newer IT job, building a lot of laptops daily, and crawling under the desk to plug and unplug the ethernet cable multiple times a day.  Requested a switch and showed the cost. Then showed the time it wastes by having me (PAYING ME) to crawl under my desk: each time, over a week, a month and annually. The Controller INSTANTLY approved my request! They were wasting 5 figures of my salary vs spending $125 CAD. 

Show the $ that matters to the boss. See it and show it from his pov. He pays the bills and it's his $$$ so show him the true cost.

The main problem, business units see you as the report guy to get them their lists out of wherever the data is (they have no idea where it is or how its gotten). Then they assess the ROI of list making and deem it not profitable.Â 

The reality, you have to track how each insight contributes to the bottom line, how those contributions taper over time without rework. This is insanely difficult outside of just wiping data clean off the slate and seeing how long it takes the business to fail in 2024.Â 

Weve been trying to convince the business side that list making is a task for support roles and not DS/DA/DE/BI teams. So they either figure out how much theyre willing to spend on a cost center to make their lists, make the lists themselves, or outsource the list making for a price cheaper than a couple of internal junior roles and an IDE.Â 

Otherwise, if they want ROI on DS/DA type work, they need to align it to profit centers and stop asking for lists. They need to accept that their gut feelings need to give way for predictives. ROI calculation is project dependent which is defined by the problem statements going in.Â 

Customer churn costs us $X annually, reducing it 2% will save us $Y. Can we predict who will churn and prescribe a set of actions to reduce churn by that mark? For each percentage, what dollar value does that translate to?Â

What specific process do you think you can improve? Why do you think it would benefit from deeper analysis? What gap are you filling? What's the potential payoff if you can achieve a realistic improvement? Are you increasing the efficiency of his line if your project succeeds? Reducing waste? Increasing product quality (on some specific dimension)? Cutting headcount?

Thinking through potential payoff is probably the easiest starting point for quantifying value. If you know the space (and you'd better if you're claiming that you can fix a CEO's problems), you should have a decent idea of his pain-points. If he's got a process running at 70% efficiency and you think it's realistic to get it to 80% with some modeling (more likely, systematic measurement and limited forecasting), then try to get his read on what that 10PP gain would be worth to him. If it's a big number, then you're in business. 

""Being more data-driven"", in the abstract, is not useful. Most people use data in their own ways. I'm sure the CEO OP referenced does too. It probably isn't a formalized process, but you'll often be surprised to find how good most competent professionals are at satisficing their jobs (they get the obvious optimizations and clean up most of the free lunch improvements).

It's kind of like stretching. If you dont' stretch a lot then you don't notice the aches/pains/lack of range of motion that you have from not stretching. Your body is your prison and you are so used to being imprisoned that you don't even see it that way. It's only after you restore that range of motion that you realise ""oh damn, I was in pain and was struggling with basic movements in my day to day life. I feel much better now that I can move more easily and with less effort, this is great"". After a while you take it for granted, focus on it less and then if the habit didn't stick then you go back to your body being your prison.

(A lot of us are deconditioned in this channel, the last paragraph isn't meant as a personal attack but do make sure to take care of your body.)

With that in mind, focus on what your key stakeholders are struggling with and try to alleviate those pains. The result of data-ignorance (as opposed to being data-driven) is a veil of anxeity, confusion and uncertainity that hangs over them. Data can't bring certainity and in a lot of ways the coping mechanisms for these problems are more along the lines of mental health. But when good quality data is there then the decision making process becomes better and things ""come together"" more often. But for the uncertainity you can alleviate, your stakeholders will understand that value a lot better.

Anyway, focus on the small wins and training your stakeholders to think in a data driven way by asking questions and challenging them where you can. In a lot of ways you are now a data therapist as opposed to a mental-health or physio therapist. :)","10"

I saw him using powerBI a few days ago because the stakeholder asked for something excel couldn't do and the page he was on was power query. I did say look, that's power query, that's all it is.

He says the dev team won't support us but I'm friends with someone on the dev team and he really wants to help. When I first started the dev guy helped me because my boss was always busy (because he's doing dashboards manually every day) dev guy talked me through it in literally 2 minutes and I added it to my excel file, showed it to my boss and I was told to take it out and told not to get help from the dev team with power query.

So you'll encounter resistance to automate even when it would save a lot of money because a middle manager is worried about what it means for them.

In 2001, I had a summer temp job for a company where the sales people would manually write down people's credit card numbers and then my job was to punch it into a credit card terminal. Hundreds of credit cards per day (it's how I got really good at 10-key). There were at least three of us who did nothing but punch credit card numbers all day. It was the dumbest job ever, but it paid $15/hr which was decent money for a summer temp gig in 2001 (SF Bay Area before the Dot Com bust) so I was fine with it. It beat the hell out of working at PetSmart for $6.35/hr, which is what I had done the previous summer. 

Anyway, there's no good reason why they couldn't have had the sales people type in the credit card numbers and then run them automatically. But my jackass of a middle manager resisted because he'd have fewer employees if it were automated (I think the excuse was security concerns, which made no sense). And the head of the IT backed him up because they drank and god knows what else together. 

All of which is to say there are a lot of morons out there. But at the same time there are good bosses too, so find a new job with one of those. 

In terms of getting better at interviews, just keep applying until it works out. I've bombed plenty of interviews in my day, so learn whatever you can from bad ones and focus on the next one. My best advice there is to go line-by-line through the job posting and have an anecdote ready that speaks to all of the core responsibilities. If it's a well-designed interview protocol (admittedly not always the case), there shouldn't be any question that comes out of the blue if you've studied the job posting. Keep your answers to 30-45 seconds and practice your delivery in front of a mirror. Use ChatGPT to help give you feedback on responses to generic behavioral interview questions.

When I interview candidates, my first filter is ""will this person be a pain in the ass to work with?"" If I pick up on that vibe, you're unlikely to advance. Secondly, I'm interested in evaluating whether they're self-aware enough and honest about the bounds of their knowledge. BTW, it's totally acceptable to say, ""I don't know"" and is often preferable to listening to really bad bullshit for several minutes.","3"

Write/type them out and start memorizing. Yes its technically lying but your answer is reflective of how you actually behave, so its really more of white lie. The question that I always struggle with is mention a time you failed and how you reacted. Honestly, I cant think of a time where I truly failed to produce some sort of project/work so I like to make something up.

Interviews in general are about presenting yourself in an easily digestible way to the interviewer. Its okay to fudge the truth to make them understand who you are.

So the question about managing stakeholders. One way to answer that would be 

when working with multiple stakeholders, communication is key. Especially on larger projects with eight or more stakeholders, its important to establish some sort of agreed upon method of communication. This could be a slack channel, email etc. As work is accomplished, its important to update people to help them understand that progress is or isnt being made. Additionally, it helps to have some sort of documentation available such as a confluence page. All of this serves to manage expectations and assuage any fears that a deadline wont be met or that the requirements will not be fulfilled.

But a lot of your post seems to be frustration with not having or being allowed to use hard skills. For that, you should probably do personal projects and build out a portfolio.","4"

I think at the end of the day. You need to get with your stakeholders and make sure youre understand the problem youre looking  to help with. Ask questions!

This is the problem with business today.


Every CEO seems to think there's some race on (there isn't) and so works the people to near mental breakdown.


Better still, contractors will claim X, only do Y, but the contract is in and they know they'll get paid, so promise the world sales side, deliver the texas sized ocean rubbish pile, colleagues feel demotivated because they are pretty efficient but have impossible expectations due to the sales pitch.


Everyone scrambles, the product/service is released in a right shitshow format, but we ""won"" the race to which nobody else was racing against us, and then its a year of patching shit, usually suboptimally.


Then the CEO takes all the money, and claims the company ""innovates"". The company ""worked through hard times and innovated to deliver"".


No, we worked through missing our family and innovated shit, we just added the bare minimum due to timelines to have something to demo"".


I am fed up of companies rushing to launch shit half finished and claiming ""innovation"".


And every company does this.


ONE time, I was freelancing, and I was ""taking too long"" to deliver some bespoke software for scientific instruments.


We cut ties, agreed on money, and I said good luck for the next guy.


1 year later they got me back, 2 other people had cobbled together the most basic bug ridden shit, but hey, they did it on time, so apparently that's good.


Anyway, they learned, gave me the time to make it properly, I charged DOUBLE my original quote, and the manager basically said ""that's cheaper than the person who messed it up"".

With that said, when working with corporate there are other factors (which other commenters have provided) in consideration. 

The only additional piece of advice I can provide (as a retired corporate executive who was a hiring manager for a global team of over 500):

Create an OT approval process with your boss. This will keep your boss respectful of last minute things (although sometimes they cannot be helped). You provide the OT request, can be just an email and they approve. Advise this needs to be done 3 days in advance of the work to be done. This will help balance your workload/priorities and will set up the expectations and agreement of both parties. 

Maybe ask if there is some comp time which could be provided in lieu of OT pay. Typically that would mean you get a day off (or groups of time such as arriving later, leaving earlier, working half days, etc) without having to take PTO or vacation days. I will caution that some states/countries have laws that prohibit this type of formal agreement.","10"

However, every now and then this is expected. I work in a global company and deadlines aren't always set in our time zone.

However it sounds like your manager is also putting you in a tricky situation by asking for work after hours or putting pressure on you to get things to them in a time that can't be met without overtime.

I would make it clear to your manager when they ask for work that they have two options a) You complete the work before the deadline, but will be logging overtime hours, or b) You won't be able to complete the work before the deadline. Where possible do these messages over email or Teams or something where you can have a record of it. (e.g. a message like ""Hi {manager's name}, Unfortunately I won't have capacity to complete the work you asked for on {project name} before the stated deadline without completing work outside of hours since my time is currently occupied by {what you're working on now}, do you believe the priority of this work necessitates the usage of overtime? Or could it be assigned to someone with more availability? Thanks"")

It sounds like it's a different situation, but as something to keep in mind I felt at the start of my career that everything had to be done ASAP, after a talk to my manager we figured out that basically I'd been misinterpreting how soon they really needed things, they became more clear on deadlines to me, and I no longer felt worked to the bone.

If boss treats it as a mix of social/professional event, he can take it the wrong way if it seems that you are avoiding it from happening. It can create tension which might lead to problems.

My recommendation is to get your team to appear busy and enforce a more strict time limit. That way you can cut to the chase, reduce the meeting time, and then afterwards you can go ""updates are happening so fast that we could benefit from reducing the frequency of the meetings"".

So, mention you've been reading about scrum/agile/whatever and you picked up a few tricks to make things more efficient (timer, sound alarm, strict schedule and bullet points to be followed, etc). Instruct your team to follow this so everything is efficient. And create an appointment for right after the meeting (""we gotta do this fast because we've got a meeting with X to discuss Y right after"" or something).

Only then you propose reducing the amount of meetings, but not because they suck, but because you're much more efficient.

It will seems like you're more invested on your work without creating any sort of tension.","1"

It helps to quickly identify cases where a project is starting to get into the weeds and maybe needs to be rescoped or replanned.

**One completely different approach:** rework the meeting to be something people get value out of. If your boss sees value in the meeting, maybe it's more important for you to figure out what is the value that he sees, and why you guys are not getting the value.

For example: I can definitely see how, in a remote environment, your boss may be trying to earmark time to have a more relaxed update to connect with people, form relationships, etc. Yes, I know some of us think that relationships don't matter and we just need to get work done, but I think generally you're going to see that stronger relationships at work lead to better communication which leads to more productive work (measured as ""working on the right things"" as opposed to ""working on the things well"").

So, talk to your boss - ask him what he is trying to get out of the meeting, and ask him if he thinks he's getting what he wants out of the meeting. And then work through that to figure out what everyone needs to do in that meeting (and then you can sneak in to maybe space it out a bit if the goal isn't just to get updates).

&gt;I would like to ask my manager (head of) to make the daily meetings actually twice/three times a week, and instead, I will brief him myself, on 1on1, even on a daily for just the management.

I think this is totally reasonable. Just go with an open mind as to why your boss may want to keep it daily as opposed to starting off with the base assumption that there is no valid reason for it.","10"

I then group (or bin, if it's continuous) data by the most influential features to see if the average conversion rate is wildly different from the predicted conversion rate.  


To use a recent example, I found that a field for the source of a lead in a customer database was the issue. A recently added source was given the same label as an older one -- the older one historically had very low conversion rates, and the new source had way higher conversions. If I then I tossed out data that had this label to see if there were any other customers with unusually high conversion rates relative to model predictions-- it appeared to have solved the issue.

You take this data and you discuss with your stakeholders, does this make sense? Did I miss anything? What else can I use? 

After that you go into a rabbit hole of data cleaning, understanding the values of the data, why is data missing? What does that mean? You do some explorative data research to get a feeling for the data.

Now again you go back to your stakeholders and you discuss your findings. Do they make sense? Are my assumptions correct?

I will also added that it's a lot of first principles thinking combined with research and leverage other people's learning.

Often times, I find it best to envision the ""idealized"" data collection setup and workflow and then work backwards to the most realistic option based on the data and pipelines and workflow we actually have.

For example, let's take your churn prediction use case. It depends a lot on how you want to use this. For example, are you trying to analyze the data so you can gather insights about the population?

Or is your goal to try and have a predictive model that will tell you which customers should be targeted with some intervention?

If it's the latter, then you can build a general framework for how to solve problems like that.

Let's say we have some intervention that we can take, such as reaching out to a customer and offering them a proactive discount on their upcoming renewal.

Then in a perfect world, we want two models. 

One model predicts the future long term profits (customer lifetime value) of a particular customer if we were to do nothing.

The other model predicts the counterfactual which would be the future long term profits (CLV) of a particular customer IF we were to intervene and offer them a discount. So, in other words:

M1 = E(CLV | do(nothing))

M2 = E(CLV | do(intervention))

Now you can go through every customer and calculate (M2 - M1) which is the causal impact on expected profits if you were to intervene and offer that proactive discount.

Now you can simple take the highest impact/ROI customers and intervene on them.

I think this is often the ""ideal"" way to approach these targeted/personalized user interventions to produce an impact on some important metric like expected profits.

There can be lots of caveats, for example you can't really estimate the interventional expectation on purely observation data. So ideally you want to perform some randomized controlled trial or A/B test to ideally collect training data or at the very least use it to test out your models trained on historical observational data.

You'll notice that this type of framework can be applied to many different problems, not just churn use cases.","3"

Non-technical managers respond to the quality of the deliverable and generally couldn't care less about how the sausage was made. That's going to be true in most organizations. Your job is to deliver answers to their questions to inform future decision-making and be able to make an explanation of it accessible to a non-technical audience. If they're not understanding pertinent issues that you feel is necessary to bring to their attention, then the shortcoming lies in the messenger.  

Honestly, there's some stuff that seem to really matters to our data engineer that I don't always fully understand. But I trust his judgment and will back him up on whatever if he says something is necessary. And my superiors trust my judgment even though they don't have a full understanding of my models. 

Part of being a ""mature"" data scientist is realizing that the expertise of others is valuable even if they don't possess your level of knowledge about data science. Everyone has a comparative advantage in something and mastery of data science only takes contributions to future decision-making so far.","1"

A solution. You don't care how they come to it, how many studies were made or what the chemical composition of the drug is, or how it differentiates from an alternative drug. All you want is a piece of paper with a name and a brief explanation on how to take them.

Same for business. No one cares about most of what we do. They only care if they need to impress a customer but even then they don't care but only want some fancy looking stuff. Our job is to do the research, and write the piece of paper with a solution. You are not dump if you don't want to dive into the chemical components of the prescribed drug, its just irrelevant to you. Same for business. Never ever use anything like the report you made in any presentation at a company. You will bore people to death with it and you will lose your audience. That's one of the most crucial things I had to learn. Always keep in mind who you are talking to and ask yourself why they listen to you. What do they want to take away from your report or presentation. Most of the time they will need to make some sort of decision. So build it around that. What is the problem they want to solve, what are the different solutions and what are the consequences of them according to your data. E.g. if they need to make the decision of they discontinue a product they don't care about plots and methodology and parameters used etc., those things do not contribute anything to the decision they need to make.

Presentations and reports are universities and those in business are enormously different. When I started I absolutely hated them, funny little graphics, very little detail etc. Though most of them are rethorically much better than any university report or presentation and that's what it is about in the end.

It's possible that your analysis is needlessly complex for the task, but it's more likely that you're finding it difficult to communicate it.

A large part of data science is storytelling and this means telling the right story for your audience. Part of this is explaining your work at the right level of difficulty. Here's some examples. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLibNZv5Zd0dyCoQ6f4pdXUFnpAIlKgm3N&amp;si=IYvpBkOWHazIu5hu

For instance, a product manager doesn't care about the neat formula I used. They care about how the product needs to change based on my results. So, I'm not going to explain Platt Scaling or Isotonic Regression. Instead, I'm going to briefly explain model calibration and show a plot of how it changes predictions and therefore outcomes. That's all they need. 

A product manager isn't being paid to understand the technical details of your analysis. That's not their job - it's yours. 

It's not about ""dumbing down"" your analysis because you always, always, always need to respect your audience and stay humble. It's simply about telling the right story. It comes with practice.

A good framework is:
1) This is the problem
2) This is how I solved it
3) This is the consequences / what it means for you 

Remember, always ask yourself:
What does my audience want?
How can I serve their interests to advance my goal?","7"

Sometimes my mentor would need to be in meetings with myself and interdisciplinary team members because things were getting lost in translation between us regarding analyses I did. They'd ask such off-the-wall and unexpected questions that I'd get tripped up and not be sure how to answer or what the true underlying question was, but he always seemed to know.

As far as what to include, it really depends on the audience. Presenting to C-suite? Only include very high-level information such as a brief summary of the type of data used, what the model does (e.g. ""this is a machine learning model to predict whether an employee will leave the organization within the next 3 months""), and how well it performed (using metrics that a layperson would understand such as accuracy, precision, confusion matrixes, etc), and any limitations the model has.

Presenting to other data scientists? I'd be prepared to get into very nitty gritty questions as they're asked and have my code and model assumptions/validation checks on stand-by.

My master's program thesis proposed a new technique to assess unknown bias in black box models and I was presenting it to a bunch of classical statisticians that weren't very familiar with neural networks or the concept of transfer learning... It was quite the challenge to be able to explain my project to them but I managed to do it pretty successfully by relating it to concepts they were already familiar (like for my demo I referenced a beta regression model instead of a neural network which is what we actually used in practice) with and using LOTS of graphics and psuedocode.","10"

You commented that your coworker didn't seem to get what you were saying about outliers skewing the average.


That might be because they really didn't get it or that the meeting was the wrong place to bring this up. Maybe they didn't know what to do with your advice in that situation or that the advice was misplaced or communicated in a way that caused offense? If they already expect you to be way too technical in your criticism, then their brain might shut off when you criticise their work.



The wayÂ toÂ figureÂ thisÂ outÂ isÂ toÂ ask them carefully. I agree though that talking about averages and outliers shouldn't be an issue for someone in a data setting. If that's the norm rather than an exception, the data maturity of your department would be very low. Since you're fairly new, I'd say you probably have to talk to people more and ask them how you could have designed your presentation better or how you could have phrased a question so that it makes more sense for them. Only in communication with your colleagues can you figure these things out and learn what is expected of / needed from you.


Personally, I think business intelligence is valuable and while it's important to differentiate one's role from other roles, you'll also benefit from working together with them. It's a balancing act and I don't have a good solution to it yet - other than saying: ""yes, one part of my job is also to do business intelligence and support the business with what they need"".



As for what to present and what not, it depends on the situation, the context and the audience. In my former job I ran molecular simulations as a service provided to my technically-minded colleagues (all PhD holders but org chemists).


Sometimes, I really needed help and feedback on the simulation method or theory, or I wanted to present new papers/findings - because I was working on this topic by myself without having anyone to talk to or who could challenge my work and tell me if my ideas made sense. My boss just said that this wouldn't fit into the general weekly meetings - which was frustrating because I didn't have any forum.


What I learned though was the following:


- I only participated in half the weekly meeting (because the second half wasn't relevant to me) and asked for regular one-on-ones with my boss.


- when I had a question, I'd approach specific people (who I knew could help me on a superficial level and with their general scientific understanding) about my problem and asked if they could help me.


- I'd present interesting topics or things that I worked on in the monthly research meetings. But made sure that I kept the relevance to my audience in mind.


- in all other meetings I ""hid"" (abstracted away) most of the technical stuff and would mostly talk about my struggles in ways that didn't go into detail, e.g.: ""I want to predict the absorption of our molecules in the visible light. I looked at different functionals A, B and C because they are well established in the research literature. It seems that the ""best"" functional didn't work quite well for our molecules and I'm unsure why that is. It is a bit confusing butÂ I'll screen (run calculations on)Â different molecules with these three functionals and then see which of them describes our molecules best. Once I figure that out, I'll present the results (and maybe we can then think whether it's worth to make one of these functionals a standard procedure).""


Other than that I'd limit what I said about the simulations - which was a real struggle because I couldn't share any of the interesting findings, technicalities or struggles - unless I asked people to specifically help me in a one-on-one.Â 


That kind of work took a lot of energy and was kinda lonely but I get it - it wasn't the main goal of the department to run calculations but to make new molecules - which put me in a supporting role.



I'm not sure if that helps you. Basically I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone with your situation. >Ã¡","12"

For example, in the FDID paper, Kathleen doesn't go into how we'd handle staggered adoption. Or, she does, but lots of the new DID estimators adjust the donor pool/control group some way. They'll compare newly treated units to never treated units, not yet treated units, or some similar approach. In the appendix, where Kathy discusses staggered treatment, she only discusses ATT.

In other words, it's as of yet unclear how the approach of throwing out treated units for newly treated units would affect things, practically and theoretically. Maybe, one could design a best of both worlds estimator, one which combines forward selection DID with this culling of the donor pool in a staggered setting to avoid the negative weights problem/forbidden comparisons.

So, if someone wishes to collaborate on that or another theoretically/methodologically relevant extension for publication, then I'm open to discussion.","1_1"

Essentially it's a systems representation of your core metrics, you map out all the things that drive your underlying metrics - and then the metrics that drive those metrics. If you can build that for the domain you work on, in a high level description for others, and in as much granularity as you need for yourself, then you'll grow almost a felt sense for what's happening in the business.

That's often where ad-hoc requests come from - some business person sees a metric go up or down that they're worried about and they wanna understand what's happening. And once you get a sense of what drives what, then you'll actually be the person proactively analyzing things and bringing it up. This is what creates trust and dependence on you for thought leadership. 

It's a common trap for analysts to be reactive to ad-hoc. Ad-hoc is a response to an ongoing conversation; if you're not in the convo, you can't anticipate. And honestly, as the person closest to the data, you should be driving the conversation. So in essence, you should be doing ad-hoc before they ask for it, if that makes sense....

I've been feeling lately that this is the #1 thing that lots of organizations get wrong! It's like everyone assumes that ad hoc exploration *has* to be this messy, slow, painful process, because that's just the way it is.

I'm literally right now 20 pages into writing a guide called ""How to be incredible at ad hoc analysis"". It's a work in progress, but I'm happy to share what I've got so far in a DM if you're interested.

There's some solid specific advice in comments already, so here's a couple higher-level, more process oriented ideas that might be helpful:

1. I think that it's important to understand what ""good messy"" is and what ""bad messy"" is for these processes. IMO people too often conflate ""fast &amp; scrappy"" with ""messy"", and wind up with crappy code, processes that sorta work but aren't reproducible, notebooks that have fallen out of date, or projects that take forever to tweak when you realize you have to change something.  
In my experience, with ad hoc stuff there's *always* some thing you forgot that you have to go back to the beginning and twiddle with, and the more painful the process of stepping back through your work is, the harder the overall project is.  
Dialing this in is key. Learn how to be ""good messy"" aka work fast and write *sorta* messy code, but not ruin your life later with undocumented sql snippets lying around in text files, or ten confusing SQL runner tabs open.
2. Make your iteration and feedback loops as tight as possible with stakeholders. This is less important if it's a question you came up with yourself, but if you have someone asking you a question the faster you can validate that you're barking up the right tree, the less likely you'll have to go back and redo stuff. With big datasets, this is even more important.  
The downside is that this can be a slow process in and of itself, but if you're able to get good at doing it rapidly, it can make the ad hoc exploration experience more rewarding (you don't feel like you toiled in the dungeon in secrecy for days) and more efficient (you can catch issues / changes really fast). Most of the time when I feel like i did a ""bad"" exploration or wasted time, it's because I should've shared a more preliminary insight sooner, or asked some clarifying questions to the requester, or something.
3. Closing the loop right can save a lot of time. For me this means two things: either create a jumping off point or a ""save point"" like in a video game, or think about turning your ad hoc work into something more evergreen. If a project is completed and it really was just a one off, taking a few minutes to decide if it's worth filing away or turning into a jumping off point for the next time you need to go down that rabbit hole can save hours next time. I have tons of little starting points that I refer back to often, and it feels fun to be able to pick back up on step 5 instead of step 1. It's a nice intermediary between ""total junk scratchpad"" and ""perfect production dashboard"", and I really embrace it.  
I also think that because of the messiness of a lot of ad hoc work, people are really resistant to turning them into evergreen assets (see: your ""I don't want to own pipelines so rarely worth keeping it updated""). It's a pain in the butt to take your janky exploration and polish it into something that's acceptable to put into production, that the data engineers will allow into their blessed pipelines, etc.  
But if you do your work just a *little* more neatly to start with, and crucially if you do it in a way that's already really easily reproducible and easy to keep updated (essentially like a bootleg pipeline), it can be a lot easier to promote ad hoc work into production without having to go back to the drawing board.

I'll also just add on that dataset imbalance is almost never a ""problem"" to be solved. Imbalance can make it a harder problem to learn, but you should never really have to ""solve"" for dataset imbalance.

The actual problem in most cases is the incorrect choice of cost function for your problem.

For example, people love to say that dataset imbalance is bad because the ""accuracy"" metric can trivially be 99% by predicting false for all samples.

But the problem here is not the imbalance, it's the choice of ""accuracy"" as your cost function which might weight false positives and false negatives equally when your problem has different costs associated with each error outcome.","1_1"

Most people seem to think that you can only use cost functions which are differentiable but this isn't true. There are ML models and algorithms that can be trained with non-differentiable cost functions like accuracy.

Also, I'm using cost function in the general sense of your ""key evaluation metric"" used to optimize your model selection during training.

For example, maybe for your particular problem, accuracy is the most important thing to optimize.

In that case, you might end up training a model with a different cost function that is differentiable, but ultimately you are performing your hyperparameter search with accuracy as your function to optimize.

So in that case, what is really your cost function? In my opinion it is a gray area because I believe hyperparameter search is actually a part of the model itself. But I know there are plenty of sticklers that would argue for hours about how it is technically different, etc.

But at that point it's mostly a discussion of semantics, which is kind of pointless to me. If you want to make a difference between those two, then I wouldn't fault you for it >7B","1_1_1_1"

Any distribution involving human interactions has the potential to shift over time and should at least have a time split tested and compared.

For example, take COVID. If you trained and deployed a model right before COVID, it probably should perform poorly in predicting loans because the data distribution changed so much.

So in your testing split, you want to see your model performs poorly on that future period with only past historical training data.

But if you don't split by time, you will actually see your model performs well because it will have some samples from all time periods including the covid period, etc.

The recall/precision scores are less pretty than the naive approach but they actually get close to how the real world performance is in prod.","1_2_1_2_1_1"

My general explanation is that pretty much every problem is meant to train on historical data so we can deploy on future unseen data in production.

Yes it could cause higher error due to distribution shift the farther you get.

However for your second question, I don't think that makes sense.

You have to ask yourself first, how often am I going to retrain this model after deployment?

If you are going to retrain it every 3 months, then your test set should be 3 months long. See what I'm getting at? Always try to simulate what your deployment goal is.

Also, don't forget that you can perform time series CV. So for example, you perform one split where May 2022 to August 2022 is your set set and all data before is your train/validation.

Then you can do another fold where your test data split is covering April 2022 to July 2022, etc. 

This will let you get a sense of how your model would have performed over a 3 month period if you had trained &amp; deployed the model at different points in time.","1_3_1"

So in your case, you want a model that can make predictions for all currently active users every month and predict which users are going to churn in that month.

You also want to train your model on all your currently available data and then deploy it on future unseen data.

So to generate your dataset, you should go through every month in the past and create a sample for every user you would have wanted to predict on.

Finally, take your entire dataset and split it by time so that your test set is ""in the future"" relative to your validation set and your validation set should be in the future relative to your train set.

It was a power simulation study comparing logistic reg vs Cox PH. Power in statistics is the probability of detecting a given effect/difference if it in fact exists. And the Cox PH approach was significantly higher (I want to say 30% but again I can't quite remember). 

I think you have to keep in mind that the two approaches are fundamentally different. Even comparing them in terms of accuracy is comparing apples with oranges. In survival for example there's no R^2 (actually, there are many, but they are seldom used) because there's no consensus nor an easy way to calculate it. Concordance measures are more useful here.

Another thing I should mention is that survival is far more popular for inference and explanatory than it is for pure prediction. I suspect this has to do with two things: first, the audience (statisticians and economists and others are more interested in the former than the latter); second, in the vast majority of cases the event is rare to begin with and pure prediction is an unrealistic goal (i.e. not enough data translating in a prediction interval so wide that is useless for decision making).

The fact that the event is often rare in these applications has other implications (beyond survival) with the choice of method: ML approaches are data hungry. This was already known, but In a recent paper (this time I remember the reference!) the authors show how survival forests and survival nnet require 150% and 200% respectively more events than traditional models like CoxPh to achieve the same learning rate (Infante et al 2023). And so when the sample size is not rich enough the stability of predictions goes down. This was shown in another paper by Riley and Collins (2023) (there's a nice YouTube video on their paper).

Right but that doesnt seem like enough to extrapolate to all other forms of ML models.

I'd suggest that you look into CUPED which is a method for using traditional ML models as a variance reduction tool to increase the power of these types of studies.

It shows pretty clearly that models with higher predictive performance will have better variance reduction and therefore higher power.

&gt;second, in the vast majority of cases the event is rare to begin with and pure prediction is an unrealistic goal (i.e. not enough data translating in a prediction interval so wide that is useless for decision making).

I think I'd probably agree here. If you have an extremely small dataset with less than one hundred events for example, then you will probably achieve better performance with simpler models that have lower variance.

I might have to disagree here. I don't think your choice of model structure should have any impact on differing results between dev and prod.

That should be pretty much entirely due to improper dataset splitting and/or construction. Regardless of any model you choose to use, you shouldn't see significant differences in dev VS prod unless you are incorrectly splitting your dataset or generating your test dataset incorrectly.

I can't think of how model choice could ever impact this. Because regardless of what model you choose, your test set construction strategy should be exactly the same.","4_5_1_1"

**It's critical that you know exactly how your model will be used before you train it**, because you need to train it in the exact way it's going to be used.

That sounds obvious when stated in those terms, but as this example shows, it's actually not trivial. But if you start your problem solving process from the bolded statement, you will probably naturally land on the correct structure of your training data.

Here, the stakeholder wants to know which users will churn in the next 30 days, so that's exactly what your model needs to predict. OP was solving almost the same problem - which users will churn over the next two years - but hadn't actually realized that was the problem they were solving, because the goal was just ""predict churn"" and the data happened to be over two years.

When you start with the end in mind - what is the business question we're answering, how will that answer be used, and what data will we have at that time to answer it - the structure of data your model needs becomes much clearer.","7"

A significant difference in target distribution is the most obvious explanation for why production performance would break down (assuming that training and inference data pipelines are properly aligned and no other engineering issues are present). If your model is training on a different reality than at inference time, you have to at least make sure that you're validating and testing on a realistic distribution. So, even if some form of resampling is helpful, you can't apply that resampling to validation/test as well.  


It sounds like you've already identified that your problem specification isn't quite right. I don't quite understand your point about balanced historical data over 2 years vs. imbalance each month - if you're only training on the last month, are you creating training data points for customers who have already churned before that month? Unless there was a big actual distribution change each month's worth of proper churn data, including the month at the end of your training data, should be in line with that 4-5% figure.","8"

Also consider using a 3 way train/test/validation split and hold out the validation set until you come up with a final model. When you mess around with your model and features based on performance on the test set, it ceases to be truly indpendent. Having that extra holdout validation set for one last check at the end can help prevent nasty surprises like this (though in this case, this wasn't likely the main problem).

Really 3 is your biggest problem. It looks ilke you realized it.

For this you should, at a minimum, be constructing your training set by taking a snapshot of current active users (CAU) at some point each month (e.g. the first of the month) and the target variable is if they churned before the next time point (the first of the next month). There are more approaches you could try but this is the basic idea- each unique user should show up in your training set for as many months as they were active in that 2 year window.


I would think of 2 more as an opportunity and less as a problem. Presumably you're already using some account age feature, as that most likely relates to propensity to churn. You might consider experimenting with features that measure consistency of user behavior over time. For example if a user is active for a certain amount of hours every month without change for a year, even if that utilization is low, maybe that's the amount of time where that user considers the service worth keeping? I would do some EDA around features like that.

Additionally, look into whether missed predictions are correlated in time, either at the population level or at the individual level. Is there some seasonality you're missing?

I would also suggest thinking of this more in terms of the calibration of your classifier rather than just the raw ""did I flag for churn last month"". For example if your classifier says there's a 60-70% chance of churn, how often do users in that bucket actually churn? Do users often show a high churn likelihood for multiple months in a row before ultimately churning?

Pure prediction vs. explanation/inference are two goals that use a similar toolbox but require a different mindset. The latter favours interpretability, generalizability of the inference, and more causal (in a loose sense) approach. The former favours out-of-sample accuracy, and possibly deployment/sustainment aspects.

If your goal is to try to identify and test the relationships between your independent and dependent variables and/or you want to be able to predict beyond your training data set, or if you simply want some nice prediction bounds for your predictions, then a Generalized Linear Model may be the way to go.

Reasons to prefer linear regression:

* Low variance, high bias.  Assuming the data generating process is stable, your model is unlikely to change appreciably when fit to new data.  This in start contrast to trees, which are _high variance models_.  There are means on reducing this variance (see boosting, bagging, etc) but the vanilla regression tree is a high variance model.

* Uncertainty quantification.  We have a very good theory for the sampling distribution of the estimates from OLS.  This allows us to make prediction intervals, confidence intervals, etc.


Reasons to prefer trees:

* Very simple explanations.  Trees are in essence a bunch of ""if this then that"" statements.  That is so easy, someone with no mathematical training could understand.  While linear models are some of the more easily interpretable models, I'm willing to bet most business people didn't like y=mx+b in high school, let alone in college (or whenever they last took math).

* Flexible conditional means.  While linear models can fit non-linear conditional expectation functions, you need to be a little smart about how one specifies the basis used (e.g. where do we place spline knots, what kind of splines do we use, etc).  Trees are more a set it and forget it approach.","14"

Companies began adding extra degree requirements for data science-type roles, as well as knowledge and experience in multiple tools, platforms, languages, techniques, certifications - the lot.

My task was to develop an Excel sheet that is imported into SolidWorks to improve the calculations on how much extra material is needed when metal sheets are bent. 

I got some materials to read through and got an introduction to SW. Then I was able to create the sheet with the help of the supervisor. It wasn't the most flashy project but it was something that could be finished in the timeframe.


I think the goal of this type of internship is to give the student a sense of accomplishment. For this it is mandatory that the project is simple enough so that it can be finished. 

I would suggest a simple linear regression. Give the student some data with one X and y and ask them to predict y based on X. To their browser you can setup a favourites folder with helpful material to read through. Ask them to try to find a suitable model.

The goal would be for them to find about linear regression themselves and then you can help in the implementation. I think linear regression is simple enough to understand as a concept. Also if the student is really fast, you can extend it to multivariate case or ask them to compare it to for example KNN.","11"

Day 2: exercises to explore the test environment, project boards and data + document where to find stuff and how to do things   
Day 3: join the standup, have something handed over for testing and have them verify the results using excel. Then have them use sql to do the same.
Day 4: same but have them find a problem and work with the owner to resolve it
Day 5: deploy something to production and demonstrate some challenges of working with large datasets

If you can manage to get included even in small ways on backend projects at your job, that's a great way to start to get exposure, even if the data isn't especially huge or the tech stack very sophisticated.

If that just isn't an option for you, there are plenty of sample databases and example tech stacks to get started. You could start with an example LAMP stack (there are many on GitHub with instructions on how to set up) and start adding the kind of deployments you are interested in.","8"

It set clear expectations on when the person/team making the request could expect to hear back from the data team to go over the details, finalize the request, and set a completion date. We put in text about general expectations (small requests may be 1 week, larger requests should anticipate 2-3 week turn around times, etc.) and that no request was considered active until that conversation with the data team took place and was approved. In the event that there was something that needed to happen urgently, it required users to submit a business justification for the request and it was automatically forwarded to the head of their respective department, head of the data team, and other senior leaders that might be impacted by such requests (client delivery team, sales, etc.). A lot of things suddenly became a lot less urgent when their last minute requests were getting blasted to leadership.

It also ended up being really helpful because it gave us a centralized record of how many requests were coming in, how long they were expected to take, how long they actually took, and what kind of staffing was required. Invaluable data when trying to ask for additional resources or saying no.","1"

We maintain a ""YAAG (Year-at-a-Glance) and Key Dates"" spreadsheet that basically schedules projects over the course of the fiscal year. When a request is made of my team, I present it to the head of my division (and/or his boss) and ask what planned work should be delayed until next year to accommodate the unplanned work. Half the time, they make the ad hoc request go away (or choose to postpone a project until next year).

We can't necessarily assume that since covariate shift can also make the existing model fail.

So the motivation of this approach is to validate that the model performance issues are due to Concept Drift.

That said, ideally when you monitor a model you don't look at this plot only. You first look at performance or estimated performance over time, then if there seem to be an issue we can use covariate and concept drift method to validate what is causing it.","6_1"
