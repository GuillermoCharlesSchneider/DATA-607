## account info, complaints, complaint type? one hot encoding, claim types? (CRM-SQL)

**NY Commercial Total Complaints per account in 2023:**
```{r}
TotalComplaints <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillermoCharlesSchneider/DATA-607/main/Final%20Project/Total%20Complaints%20Per%20Account.csv")

names(TotalComplaints)[1] <- "Account.Id"
```

**NY Commercial Count of Complaint types per account in 2023:**
```{r}
ComplaintTypes <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillermoCharlesSchneider/DATA-607/main/Final%20Project/Complaint%20Types%20Per%20account%20(convert%20to%20one%20hot).csv")
```


**NY Commercial Count of Members per account in 2023:** *i filtered out the recent 2024 hires, and made sure to include members who left in 2024, but were on the roster in 2023, i think ultimately the number is very close to just pulling the current 2024 roster today, due to most places total job count staying relatively stable*

```{r}
MemberCountAtAccounts <- read.csv("")
```






```{r}
#join in the total complaints for that account
MERGED <- StewardPoints %>% left_join(TotalComplaints)

# NA's to 0
MERGED$Number.of.Complaints[is.na(MERGED$Number.of.Complaints)] <- 0
```





Graph:

```{r}
ggplot(MERGED, aes(x=Number.of.Complaints, y=Leader.Points)) + 
    geom_point()
```
