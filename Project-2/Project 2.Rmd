### **Load three wide datasets .CSV**

 use tidyr and dplyr as needed to
tidy and transform your data. [Most of your grade will be based on this step!]

## **Data Set 1 (CPI) **

**Data Set 1 (CPI) Load:**
```{r}
CPI <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillermoCharlesSchneider/DATA-607/main/Project-2/CPI%202024.csv", sep =",")
```


**Data Set 1 TIDYING (tidyr and dplyr):** 
```{r}
#remove blanks
clean_CPI <- CPI %>%
  filter(!CPI$X=="")

#rename cols
  colnames(clean_CPI) <- c(
    "Indent Level",
    "Expenditure category",
    "Relative importance Dec. 2023",
    "Unadjusted indexes Jan. 2023",
    "Unadjusted indexes Dec. 2023",
    "Unadjusted indexes Jan. 2024",
    "Unadjusted percent change Jan. 2023- Jan. 2024",
    "Unadjusted percent change Dec. 2023- Jan. 2024",
    "Seasonally adjusted percent change Oct. 2023- Nov. 2023",
    "Seasonally adjusted percent change Nov. 2023- Dec. 2023",
    "Seasonally adjusted percent change Dec. 2023- Jan. 2024"
    )

clean_CPI <- data.frame(clean_CPI[-1, ])

#pivot to long form
long_CPI <- clean_CPI %>%
  pivot_longer(
    3:11,
    names_to = "indexes", 
    values_to = "value"
  )
```


**Data Set 1 ANALYSIS:**
```{r}

#filter for just jan 23 to jan 24 index name
graph1 <- long_CPI %>%
  filter(long_CPI$indexes=="Unadjusted.percent.change.Jan..2023..Jan..2024")

#tilted the text for readability
graph1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Expenditure.category,as.numeric(value)),
             y=as.numeric(value)))+
  geom_col()+
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=65, vjust=1, hjust=1))+
ggtitle("Unadjusted Percent Change Jan 2023 to Jan 2024") +
  xlab("Expenditure Category") + ylab("Percent Change")

```
```{r}
#filtered for dec 23 to jan 24 index name
graph2 <- long_CPI %>%
  filter(long_CPI$indexes=="Seasonally.adjusted.percent.change.Dec..2023..Jan..2024")

#again tilted for readability
graph2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Expenditure.category,as.numeric(value)),
             y=as.numeric(value)))+
  geom_col()+
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=65, vjust=1, hjust=1))+
ggtitle("Seasonally Adjusted Percent Change Dec 2023 to Jan 2024") +
  xlab("Expenditure Category") + ylab("Percent Change")
```

**Question: Which spending categories have experienced the most inflation and the least? In the last month and over the whole year?**

Answer: 

Over the whole year, Jan 2023 to Jan 2024, Motor Vehicle Insurance experienced the most inflation (20.6%), and Utility (piped) Gas Service experienced the least (-17.8%). 

Over the last month of 2023, Dec 2023 to Jan 2024 (Seasonally adjusted), Utility (piped) Gas Service experienced the most inflation (2.0%), and Fuel oil experienced the least (-4.5%). 


## **Data Set 2 (Marriage)**

**Data Set 2 (Marriage) Load:**

```{r}
Marriage <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillermoCharlesSchneider/DATA-607/main/Project-2/Marriage.csv", sep =",")
```

**Data Set 2 TIDYING (tidyr and dplyr):** 
```{r}

Clean_Marriage <- data.frame(Gender = "Male", Marriage[-c(1:2,17:37), ])
Clean_Marriage$Gender[c(8:14)] <- "Female"
Clean_Marriage <- data.frame(Clean_Marriage[-c(1,8), ])


Long_Marriage <- Clean_Marriage %>%
  pivot_longer(
    3:14,
    names_to = "marriage", 
    values_to = "value"
  )

```


**Data Set 2 ANALYSIS**

```{r}
#never married female, remove %
Female_Never_Married <- Long_Marriage %>%
  filter(Long_Marriage$Gender == "Female", Long_Marriage$marriage == "United.States..Never.married..Estimate")

Female_Never_Married$value <- str_remove_all(Female_Marriage$value,"[\\%]")

Female_Never_Married$Change <- NA

# change in brackets
for (i in 2:6){
  Female_Never_Married$Change[i] <- as.numeric(Female_Never_Married$value[i]) - as.numeric(Female_Never_Married$value[i-1])
}

#never married male, remove %
Male_Never_Married <- Long_Marriage %>%
  filter(Long_Marriage$Gender == "Male", Long_Marriage$marriage == "United.States..Never.married..Estimate")
  
Male_Never_Married$value <- str_remove_all(Male_Marriage$value,"[\\%]")

Male_Never_Married$Change <- NA

# change in brackets
for (i in 2:6){
  Male_Never_Married$Change[i] <- as.numeric(Male_Never_Married$value[i]) - as.numeric(Male_Never_Married$value[i-1])
}

#comparing change in age brackets from male to female
Male_Never_Married$Male_compared_to_female <- NA

for (i in 2:6){
  Male_Never_Married$Male_compared_to_female[i] <- as.numeric(Male_Never_Married$Change[i]) - as.numeric(Female_Never_Married$Change[i])
}
```





**Question: In 2022 when this data was collected, what age bracket for males and females is the change in the proportion that have ever been married the largest?**

Answer: 

Largest difference between age brackets in "Males Never Married" is from the "20 to 34 years" age bracket (71.3%) to the "35 to 44 years" age bracket (29.3%), a change of -42.0%

Largest difference between age bracket in "Females Never Married" is from the "20 to 34 years" age bracket (63.5%) to the "35 to 44 years" age bracket (23.6%), a change of -39.9%

The change from the "15 to 19 years" age bracket to the  "20 to 34 years" age bracket has the largest gap between Males (-27.6%) and Females (-35.2%) at 7.6%


## **Data Set 3 (Sheds)**

**Data Set 3 (Sheds) Load:**

```{r}
Sheds <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillermoCharlesSchneider/DATA-607/main/Project-2/Sheds.csv", sep =",")
